136,Why Crypto Adoption Stalled – And What Can Restart It,"The number of cryptocurrency users could exceed 900 million globally by the end of this year, if recent growth rates hold. Total market cap is well into the trillions of dollars, and is projected to keep increasing over the next five years.  Even so, crypto would remain a niche asset class rather than the currency of choice for most of the world’s 8 billion inhabitants. At this moment, the user penetration rate is barely 7%. So let’s be clear on what’s bogging down the pace at which people begin to accept crypto. Then let’s figure out what to do about it.  The first part is the easiest, because it boils down to one word: Trust.  Institutional investors have come to adopt crypto, signalling their acceptance by launching ETFs securitizing spot Bitcoin and Ether. But that’s not growing crypto’s wallet share – it’s cannibalizing it instead. Rather than going on DeFi apps to buy and sell digital currencies, everyday retail investors conduct transactions from their more familiar legacy brokerage accounts.  And that should be a wakeup call for the crypto space. At a time when the entire industry should be doing all it can to garner the trust of the average retail investor, many on the inside may be ignoring layers of baked-in complexity that make people yearn for the relative comfort of their stockbrokers’ apps. After all, familiarity fosters trust, while complexity often breeds doubt and skepticism. “Bridging the gap to mainstream adoption requires addressing a fundamental trust deficit,” says Brian Breslin, a senior executive atTELUS Digital,a global firm that integrates artificial intelligence and human agents to deliver seamless customer experiences for crypto. “The future of sustainable growth and mainstream crypto adoption hinges on a dedicated, industry-wide commitment to prioritizing the new, non-technical customer.""  Breslin identifies three major contributors to this trust deficit: These are all elements of the broader CX ecosystem – every bit as much as the user interface. Still,UI/UX friction pointsremain the most important of these factors, and CX for many crypto exchanges is fraught with non-intuitive processes. These result in: Every point at which new or potential users come into contact with the DeFi product is a point where the platform can lose them. That’s where a strong customer support presence comes in. The days when a static list of FAQs would suffice are long gone. Chatbots have their use cases, but they don’t comprehend the world the way humans do, and their lack of situational awareness can put people off. DeFi leaders need to understand one thing that traditional financial services providers have always understood: This is a people business. “Often there's a gap between what a customer is actually experiencing on a crypto or digital assets platform and what the platform itself thinks is the experience it's delivering,” Breslin says. “So we look at what is the user journey, how can we improve the sentiment or the sense of trust at the different points of that journey.” This journey begins with onboarding, and the platform that loses its customers here is unlikely to ever get them to proceed – and almost certainly will never get them back. This isn’t a matter of an abandoned cart; this represents the evaporation of each prospect’s lifetime value.Onboarding needs to be streamlined and rendered much more intuitive, and AI can help automate what had previously been manual processes. The first, and perhaps biggest hurdle for DeFi in this regard is the Know Your Client (KYC) process. Everyone who signs up must provide – and must be willing to provide – personal data and sometimes banking information. This must be documented by government-sanctioned photo ID, proof of address, biometric verification and a background check.  “The initial onboarding is hypercritical,” Breslin says, noting that 63% of potential customers abandon financial services apps at this point. “There's a lot of frustration when you're going through delays. So we look at that user journey through the KYC process. We bring in procedures to let the user know why there is a KYC process and that in itself builds trust. We also update the timeline so users can track their progress and see where they are in the journey.”  Even so, that’s just the beginning of the CX requirements. Proactive and transparent communications should be applied to security and privacy concerns, which will only become more critical as the new client becomes a more frequent user. This means having an accessible, knowledgeable customer support team and this is where AI can really make a difference. While AI- supported self-service should be an option, users should also have the choice to speak with a human agent. Backed by an AI-fueled knowledge base and next-best action engine, a human agent can give users the most up-to-date and authoritative answers and optimal suggestions with a personal touch.  “When it does get to the point that users need to interact with an agent, we use AI to streamline the process by providing agents with solutions such as next-best-action recommendations, interaction histories, and automated article suggestions from knowledge bases so they can get to the most accurate answer a lot more quickly,” according to Breslin.  Additionally, while crypto platforms operate in highly-regulated environments, meeting those obligations doesn’t have to mean creating points of friction for users. A thoughtfully designed customer journey can make compliance feel seamless.  He notes that working with a partner such as TELUS Digital, which has a commitment to providing ongoing training and upskilling for its CX agents, helps them stay up-to-date with new global regulations as they emerge. By focusing on delivering trusted, secure, seamless customer experiences, crypto platforms can significantly lower the barrier to entry for new users. Improving CX often leads to increased user confidence, greater adoption rates and stronger ongoing engagement. ""Ultimately, a positive and trustworthy customer experience will be a key differentiator for crypto platforms looking to expand their user base and achieve mainstream adoption,"" Breslin says. Trust is no longer just a brand value. Rather, it’s a core operational function in customer experience. This is particularly true in crypto. Any industry in which users entrust platforms with personal data and digital identities – not to mention money – must instill trust into every step of the customer journey from onboarding and verification to transparency in transactions and support responsiveness. Platforms must attract and engage users before they can move on to that even greater challenge: retaining them. It's all about building systems, policies and experiences that prove the platform is secure, ethical and accountable. TELUS Digital is among a select few thought leaders specializing in developing end-to-end CX journeys for crypto projects as well as building intuitive and user-friendly mobile applications for some of the world's most trusted brands.

138,"DOGE, XRP, ETH, SOL Follow Bitcoin Through the Cloud as Altcoin Momentum Builds"," This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. About two weeks ago, I discussed bitcoin's (BTC) bullish breakout above a technical resistance called the Ichimoku cloud andpotential for a rally to $100,000. This week, the cryptocurrency obligingly surged into six figures. Now, top alternative cryptocurrencies such as memecoinDOGE, payments-focusedXRP, the Ethereum blockchain's ether (ETH) and Solana'sSOLhave also crossed above the cloud, flashing bullish signals. The analysis, developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s, is used to identify support and resistance, momentum and trend change in price actions. The indicator comprises five lines: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K), and a lagging closing price line. The gap between the first two lines makes the cloud. Crossovers above and below the Ichimoku cloud are taken to represent bullish and bearish shifts in momentum. The chart shows XRP and DOGE moving above their respective Ichimoku clouds, signaling more gains. In XRP's case, the breakout shifts focus to resistance at around 30 cents, characterized by the trendline falling from February highs. DOGE is trading close to its bear market trendline, which, if topped, would expose resistance at $3.02, the lower high created on March 2. In ETH's case, the breakout has opened the doors to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,700. Meanwhile, SOL may encounter resistance at $218, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the January to April sell-off.

139,What’s Next for Bitcoin With Crypto Market Cheering Trump's Trade Deal Hype?,"Bitcoin (BTC) is fast closing on the $100,000 mark as U.S. President Donald Trump teased a major trade deal, with reports suggesting it could be with the U.K. The upswing in prices is consistent with the cryptocurrency's broader bullish technical setup and buoyant risk sentiment in traditional markets. As of this writing, the Asian stocks traded higher, with the futures tied to the S&P 500 up by 0.6%. Still, a couple of factors suggest the $100,000 breakout may not be a smooth ride. Firstly,as per the Wall Street Journal, the big trade deal that Trump teased on Truth Social could be a ""framework of an announcement with tariff adjustments."" In other words, the impending announcement could be a framework of discussions that could lead to a trade deal weeks or months from now. So, the bullish momentum in BTC could slow once the initial optimism fades. Asdiscussed earlier this week, the $99,900 could prove a tough nut to crack due to the potential for increased selling pressure from those who bought coins around these levels early this year and profit taking by long-term holders. Coinbase premium indicator, which measures the spread between BTC's dollar-denominated price on the Coinbase exchange and tether-denominated price on Binance, is widely seen as a proxy for demand from the U.S.-based investors. In the past, sustained BTC bull runs have been characterized by an uptick in the Coinbase premium. However, since late April, the seven-day moving average of the Coinbase premium has diverged bearishly from the price. While BTC set a new multi-week high during the Asian session, the 14-hour relative strength index, an indicator used to gauge momentum and overbought and oversold conditions, didn't follow suit. The resulting bearish divergence suggests the momentum may be weakening.

140,Bettors Lose Millions Predicting the New Pope as Polymarket Edge Fizzles Out,"Bettors on crypto prediction platform Polymarket have, in recent months, developed an enviable reputation for beating the bookies. So it came as a surprise on Thursday when they got the outcome of the papal conclave very wrong indeed. Winner Robert Francis Prevost wasn’t among the favorites, with bettors only giving the US-born cardinal around a 1% chance of succeeding Pope Francis ahead of the result. Polymarket bettors, like traditional betting markets, gave Cardinal Pietro Parolin the highest odds, at 28%. With over$28 millionof bets placed on candidates other than Prevost, the result was a total wipeout for many bettors. The event throws into question the perceived heightened accuracy of betting markets like Poymarket over conventional polls. Polymarket lets users bet on the outcomes of everything from soccer fixtures to political elections. Unlike traditional betting platforms, where the house sets the odds based on its best diligence, Polymarket odds are a real-time reflection of the bets placed by users. Simply put, the more demand there is for a certain outcome, the higher the odds and the prices paid for the bets are. In November, Polymarket gained mainstream notoriety when bettors gave Republican candidate Donald Trump significantly higher odds than most other sources to win the US presidency. “Polymarket prices seem to be wrapping up the views of smart money pretty well,” Koleman Stumpf, an economics professor at Wake Forest University in North Carolina,toldCoinDesk at the time, noting that Polymarket bettors appeared to have a slight edge in predicting the election outcome. A historical dataanalysisconducted by New York City-based data scientist Alex McCullough showed Polymarket previously predicted the outcome of world events one month out with 90% accuracy. The reason Polymarket bettors got the papal conclave result so wrong is that the event is extremely hard to predict, Domer, one of Polymarket’s top pseudonymous bettors,saidon X. “It's like walking into a store that doesn't communicate with the outside world,” he said. “Not even the participants themselves would probably know how to handicap it.” Since it’s hard for bettors to find an edge with such an esoteric bet, many likely defaulted to following the opinions of traditional betting markets and the media, resulting in the close alignment of odds between Polymarket and other betting markets likeBetfair. The rarity of papal conclaves may also have made things difficult. Pope Francis, the previous pope, was appointed in 2013, years before blockchain-based betting platforms like Polymarket existed. It's also possible that many Polymarket bettors likely had no prior experience betting on the event. Political elections, where Polymarket odds have lined up closer to results, are much more frequent and widely understood. According to Domer, the real edge in betting on the papal conclave is not choosing the correct candidate but rather betting against those with too-high odds. He chalked up the high odds of heavy favorites Parolin, and Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, who Polymarket bettors gave a 20% chance of winning, to their popularity with the public and the media. ""The pricing for Parolin and Tagle were way too high, and high for not very good reasons,” he said.

141,"Bitcoin's Price Surge to $104K Liquidates Nearly $400M in Bearish BTC Bets, Opening Doors to Further Gains","Bitcoin's rapid price rally has caught traders off guard, triggering large liquidations of bearish short positions. The leading cryptocurrency by market value has risen over 3% to $102,500 in the past 24 hours, with prices topping $104,000 at one point, the highest since Jan. 31. The bullish move came as President Donald Trump announced a comprehensive trade deal with the U.K. and the cumulative inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hit a record high above $40 billion. The broader market rallied as well, with the total market cap of all coins excluding BTC surging by 10% to $1.14 trillion, the highest since March 6, according to data source TradingView. That has led to substantial liquidations of bearish short positions, or leveraged plays aimed at profiting from price losses. A position is liquidated or forced closed when the trader's account balance falls below the required margin level, often due to adverse price movements. This leads the exchange to close the position to prevent further losses automatically. Nearly $400 million in BTC short positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours—marking the highest single-day total since at least November, according to Coinglass. Meanwhile, $22 million in long positions were also wiped out. This significant imbalance indicates that leverage was heavily tilted towards the bearish side, and the rapid liquidation of shorts suggests there could be more upside potential for the market ahead.

142,"Explosive ETH, ADA, DOGE Moves Spur $800M in Short Liquidations, Highest Since 2023","A broad crypto rally led by ether’s (ETH) 20% surge triggered more than $750 million in short liquidations in the past 24 hours, the highestsingle-day total since 2023for bearish trades. Data from CoinGlass shows that over 84% of the total liquidations came from shorts, with major altcoins jumping 10%–20% in the span of a few hours starting late Thursday. Ether led the charge with a 20% rise, pushing past $2,000 for the first time since early March. DOGE and Cardano’s ADA zoomed more than 10%, fueled by bullish sentiment and momentum trading, with Solana’s SOL, BNB and xrp (XRP) up at least 7%. Liquidations occur when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position due to insufficient margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position, that is, when they don't have sufficient funds to keep the trade open. Large-scale liquidations can indicate market extremes, like panic selling or buying. A cascade of liquidations might suggest a market turning point, where a price reversal could be imminent due to an overreaction in market sentiment. As such, the uptick in crypto markets came as bitcoin surged above $100,000 on Thursday, with sentiment buoyed on a trade deal between the U.S. and the UK. The late Thursday wipeout ranks among the most severe since bitcoin’s run to $93,000 in March, which saw bears lose over $550 million in a weekend squeeze. In April, a similar rally in ETH and DOGE erased $500 million in shorts — but this move surpassed both, showing renewed risk appetite and a crowded short trade setup. Coinglass data shows that the largest share of losses came from Binance and OKX, which accounted for more than $500 million in liquidations. ETH alone was responsible for over $310 million, while bitcoin-tracked futures led at $375 million. The short squeeze on ETH came as the asset had been range bound for a few weeks amid falling institutional interest and retail sentiment. But Ethereum’srecent Pectra upgrademay be giving traders a reason to bet on the asset, some say.

144,CoinDesk Weekly Recap: Even ETH Is Up,"It was a pretty positive week for crypto as prices rose, big deals were signed, and stablecoins continued to penetrate deep into the financial system.

Bitcoin was near ATH levels this week on the back of more positive “trade” news. Bearishpositions were liquidatedand ETF flows were up, Omkar Godbole reported. ETH’s resurgence may have had something to do with itsPectra upgrade, which went off without a hitch (as Ethereum upgrades tend to). Pectra will make staking easier (and bigger) and boost efficiency. Margaux Nijkerk, our Ethereum reporter, had the news. Coinbase signed the biggest acquisition in crypto history, a $2.9 billion deal for Deribit, a crypto options pioneer. Wall Street analysts said Coinbase is now agenuine player in derivatives, rivaling Binance. Still, the deal couldn’t boost Coinbase’s stock price, which took a hit on tariff-affected Q1earnings. Helene Braun wrote about that. About those stablecoins… Meta (formerly Facebook) looks set to jointhe integration party; asdoes Stripe. But Senate Democrats arestalling the stablecoin bill, citing concerns about numerous questionable Trump crypto ventures.

145,Celsius Founder Alex Mashinsky Sentenced to 12 Years in Prison for Fraud,"NEW YORK, NY — Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius Network, was sentenced to 12 years in prison on Thursday for fraud.  Judge John Koeltl of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) handed down the sentence, saying the 12 years — composed of a 120-month sentence to be served concurrently with a separate 144-month sentence for the two charges Mashinsky pled guilty to — reflected Mashinsky’s “extremely serious” crimes. The sentence splits the difference between the mere one year and a day in prison requested by his defense team, and the 20 years suggested by prosecutors. He has also agreed to forfeit $48 million and several pieces of real estate.  “No matter what the sentence, the sentence will not cure the monetary or psychological harm caused to the victims,” Koeltl said.  Before Celsius’ collapse in 2022, Mashinsky repeatedly lied to investors about the safety of their deposits. He falsely claimed that Celsius had regulatory approval, he insisted that the platform did not make uncollateralized loans when, in fact, it did, and he lied about selling his CEL tokens while manipulating the price for his own financial gain – making over $48 million in profit from CEL alone, prosecutors said. Mashinsky’s poor leadership and self-dealing drove Celsius into bankruptcy, leaving a gaping $1.2 billion hole — which prosecutors said is more like $7 billion at today’s prices — in the company’s balance sheet.  When Celsius did collapse, over 100,000 creditors claimed they lost a collective $4.7 billion according to initial bankruptcy documents.  “Alexander Mashinsky targeted retail investors with promises that he would keep their ‘digital assets’ safer than a bank, when in fact he used those assets to place risky bets and to line his own pockets,” U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a statement. “In the end, Mashinsky made tens of millions of dollars while his customers lost billions. America’s investors deserve better. The case for tokenization and the use of digital assets is strong but it is not a license to deceive. The rules against fraud still apply, and the SDNY will hold those who flout them accountable for their crimes.”  In both their pre-sentencing documents and in their testimony in court on Thursday, Mashinsky and his lawyers attempted to downplay the one-time CEO’s role in the fraud. His lawyers told the court that Mashinsky “has not a malicious bone in his body” and that the government’s attempt to characterize him as the architect of a fraud scheme was “a hoax.”  Mashinsky wept as his lawyer, Marc Mukasey, told the court of his personal characteristics — including his military service in the Israeli army, his alleged track record of hiring homeless people to work at his various companies and, bafflingly, about his ongoing work on a non-fiction book about gravity since his arrest — which he urged the judge to consider as mitigating factors for Mashinsky’s sentence. When Mashinsky himself spoke to the judge, he cried intermittently as he apologized for the harm caused to his victims.  “As someone who came from nothing, I recognize how hard people work to earn, save and invest in crypto,” Mashinsky said. “I respectfully ask the victims for forgiveness and I apologize to all of them for my mistakes. I’m truly sorry.”  Six of those victims spoke in court on Thursday, detailing their pain and suffering in the aftermath of Celsius’ collapse.  One victim, Cameron Crewes, told the court that Mashinsky and his lawyers’ spin on his conduct was a “horrific minimization” of the damage he caused at Celsius.  “Defense says he’s working on a new book about gravity, but he seems not to understand the gravity of the situation,” Crewes said, adding that at least 231 Celsius creditors have died since the platform’s collapse, and will never be made whole.  Another creditor, Hollis Waite, described how he was “woefully unprepared” to send his two young children to college after losing a significant chunk of his savings in Celsius. Yet another, Hugh Mitton, told the court that he’d lost sleep, his mental health, and his time since Celsius’ collapse. Mitton took issue with Mashinsky’s lawyers’ characterization that he was voluntarily missing his son’s college graduation, also on Thursday, in order to attend his sentencing and take responsibility for his crimes.  “[He] doesn’t make mention of all the people who can no longer afford to send their kids to university,” Mitton said.  Both victims and prosecutors pointed to Mashinsky’s continued failure to take real accountability for the actions that led to Celsius’ downfall, as well as the financial gain he and his wife Krissy made from Celsius, even during its collapse and subsequent bankruptcy – after which Krissy sold t-shirts saying “Unbankrupt Yourself,” a spin on Celsius’ “Unbank Yourself” slogan.  Mashinsky was stone-faced as he listened to his victims’ testimony. When the judge handed down the sentence, he seemed genuinely surprised, saying:  “I feel that while I am here to take responsibility, I am taking responsibility for a thousand employees. Not one of them has come forward to say what they have done. That’s it, your honor.”  As part of his plea agreement, Mashinsky is unable to appeal his sentence. He was ordered to self-report to prison to start his sentence in September. His lawyers requested that he be allowed to serve his sentence at FCI Otisville, a medium-security prison in New York that's also a temporary home to Mango Markets exploiter Avi Eisenberg, who wasrecently sentenced to four years in prison for the possession of child pornography.  If he serves the entirety of his sentence, Mashinsky will be 72-years-old upon release. On the news team at CoinDesk, Cheyenne focuses on crypto regulation and crime.

147,How the Democrats’ Path to 2026 Victory Goes Through Decentralized Crypto,"The latest Crypto-and-Congress news is all about the Senate Democrats gettingcold feeton the stablecoin bill (the GENIUS Act). The same bill they voted forjust two months ago. Why the flip-flop? Because they don’t like Trump andthey think the bill will help him profit. Why the Democrats keep hitting “replay” on this losing message is beyond me. Hating on Trump does not win elections. Just refer to the electoral bloodbath of 2024. But here’s the kicker: Crypto isn’t the threat, it’s the opportunity. If Democrats dropped their losing soundbites long enough to really learn crypto, they wouldn’t just write better policy, they’d rewrite their political future in 2026. In 2024, Democrats lost a generation. Young men who had historically leaned in hard for Democrats, fled. In just four years, young men went from backing Biden to giving Trump a30-point swing,flipping hard against the very candidate they once rejected. While there’s plenty of soul-searching to be done about why, one answer is hiding in plain sight: crypto. Yes, crypto. And despite Big Crypto’s talking points, it’s not because young male voters are single-issue crypto voters.They’re not. It’s because crypto, like other emerging technologies of the past, reflects generational and gender divides that mirror the trends we’re seeing among young male voters. According to aPew Research Center survey, 41% of young men have used crypto. This is orders of magnitude greater than young women (16%) and people over 50 (8%). So even if that young male voter isn’t holding crypto himself, 42% of his peer group is. It’s in his social media feeds, his podcast rotations, his group chats. And right now, he’s hearing only one side of the story, because Democrats have refused to learn the tech. It’s important to remember that these young men aren’t all online crypto scammers. They are the same ones who overwhelminglyshareDemocratic values such as “basic health insurance is a right” and the “government should spend more to reduce poverty.” The Democrats can keep calling crypto a criminal enterprise over and over, but it doesn’t make it one. The only effective thing it does is tell all young men that the Dems want to cancel them. And we’ve seen how young men have punished them for it at the voting booth. Let’s say the quiet part out loud: the crypto-natives don’t want to see Trump as the face of this community. He and his family are promoting the same kind of rug-pull projects that the crypto community has spent years battling. So why did young men vote for him? Because even with the grifting, he isn’t completely ignoring them or, worse, pretending they’re something they’re not. Go to any crypto meetup or conference and you’ll know that the builders aren’t about hype tokens or centralized projects propped up only by endorsements. Crypto is about giving people control of their money, their data, and their digital identity. The ethos is grounded in the earned distrust of centralized institutions: Wall Street, Big Tech, and the federal government (most recently proven by the speed of DOGE’s access to all of our data). The community’s oft-quoted mantras prove the point: ● “Don’t trust. Verify.” ● “Not your keys, not your coins.” ● “If you don’t know where the yield comes from,youare the yield.” These are not the vibes of blind allegiance. The crypto community was born out of the 2008 financial crisis, when banks collapsed under their own misconduct and taxpayers footed the bill. Embedded within Bitcoin’sgenesis blockis the hardcoded reminder: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” The Democrats’ insistence of conflating that community with Trump’s opportunism is lazy. The obvious consequence has been to push away the very voters they desperately need. Sure, some politicians may be a little scared of the campaign money involved: Crypto PACs have raised over$260 million,making crypto the sixth largest Super PAC, dwarfing any other industry-supported Super PAC (all the others are related to a particular party or candidate). But those donations came from just 50 individuals. That’s not a movement. It’s a small elevator lobby. Meanwhile, there’s a whole voter base of millions of young men who turned to crypto because of their mistrust of Wall Street and Big Tech. The same mistrust Democrats share of those same centralized entities. Democrats don’t have to embrace hype coins or endorse bad legislation. In fact, they shouldn’t. But they do need to actually learn to embrace the core values of the builders in the crypto community: individual digital ownership and decentralization. Democrats also need to start demonstrating this now. They can’t risk another cycle without bringing young men back under the tent. One cycle can be a blip, but two cycles in a row becomes a habit, and habits are hard to break. The GENIUS Act is actually the perfect opportunity for the Democrats to show that they’re a party that is more interested in voters than soundbites against Trump. Thecurrent draftis 57 pages of legislative jargon to elevate the roles of centralized entities in overseeing stablecoins. No surprise. Remember those 50 individuals who raised $260 million for the crypto Super PAC? They’ll definitely benefit from an increased reliance on their intermediation. But embedded in the draft legislation is a small definition that is doing a lot of work, and that’s the definition of “distributed ledger.” Instead of hating on Trump, the Democrats could band together to say that the definition doesn’t require decentralization or network security, and until that happens, they can’t advance a stablecoin bill that only promotes fee-taking central intermediaries. Now that could be the beginning of a real sea-change. The Democrats wouldn’t even need to mention Trump. The reality would be that none of the Trump family crypto projects would survive a definition that required true decentralization. So here’s the real question: do Democrats want to keep losing elections just to avoid learning new tech? Or are they finally ready to act like a party that wants to win votes again?

149,Stabledollars: The Third Act of Dollar Reinvention,"Eight decades of dollar history can be read as a three-act play. Act Iwas the Eurodollar—off-shore bank deposits that sprang up in 1950s London so the Soviet bloc, European exporters, and eventually every multinational could hold dollars outside U.S. regulation, spawning a multi-trillion-dollar shadow banking base. Act IIwas the Petrodollar. After 1974, OPEC’s decision to price crude in dollars hard-wired global energy demand to U.S. currency and gave Washington an automatic bid for its Treasury bills. John deVadoss will appear in the “IEEE x Consensus Research Symposium: What's next in Agentic AI?” at Consensus 2025 on May 16 at 11:00am-12:30pm. Act IIIis unfolding now. USD-backed Stabledollars (a.k.a. stablecoins)—on-chain tokens fully collateralized by T-bills and cash—have leapt past $230 billion in circulating supply and, on many days, settle more value than PayPal and Western Union combined. The dollar has reinvented itself again—this time as amonetary API: a permissionless, programmable unit that clears in seconds for a fraction of a cent. Follow the incentives and the shape of the future appears. A Lagos merchant can accept USDC on her phone, skip 20% naira slippage, and restock inventory the same afternoon. A Singapore hedge fund parks cash in tokenized T-bill vaults yielding 4.9%, then routes those dollars into a swap at 8 a.m. New-York time without a correspondent bank. A Colombian gig worker converts weekend wages to digital dollars, bypasses capital controls, and withdraws pesos at a neighborhood ATM—no Friday-to-Monday lag, no 7% remit fee. Stablecoins haven’t replaced the banking system; they have tunneled around its slowest, most expensive choke points. Scale begets legitimacy. TheGENIUS Actmoving through the U.S. Senate would charter stable-coin issuers nationally and, for the first time, open a path to Fed master accounts. Treasury staff already model a $2 trillion stable-coin float by 2028—enough to rival the entire Eurodollar stock of the early 1990s. That projection is plausible: Tether and Circle command over 90% share with reserves lodged almost entirely in short-dated U.S. debt, meaning foreigners are effectively holding digitized T-bills that settle in 30 seconds. The dollar’s network-effect is migrating from SWIFT messages to smart-contract calls, extending hegemony without printing a single new note. Yet, the Stabledollar epoch is no risk-free triumph. Private tokens that wrap sovereign money raise hard questions. Who conducts monetary policy when a third of the offshore float lives in smart contracts? What recourse does a Venezuelan family have if an issuer black-lists its wallet? Will Europe—or the BRICS—tolerate a rails-level dependence on a U.S.-regulated asset? These are governance puzzles, but they are solvable if policymakers treat stablecoins as critical dollar infrastructure, not as speculative irritants. The playbook is straightforward: Do that, and the United States creates a digital-dollar moat wider than any rival’s CBDC, including China’s. Shrug, and issuance will migrate offshore, leaving Washington to police a shadow system it no longer controls. Dollar hegemony has always advanced by hitching itself to the dominant trade flow of the age: Eurodollars financed post-war reconstruction; petrodollars lubricated the fossil-fuel century; Stabledollars are wiring the high-velocity, software-eaten economy. Ten years from now, you won’tseethem; they will simply be the water we swim in. Your local café will quote prices in pesos or pounds but settle in tokenized dollars under the hood. Brokerages will sell “notes” that are really bearer instruments programmable for collateral calls. Payroll will arrive in a wallet that auto-routes savings, investments, and charitable gifts the instant it clears. The only open question is whether the United States will steward the upgrade it accidentally birthed. Stablecoins are already the fastest-growing quasi-sovereign asset class. Harness them with serious rules and the dollar’s third great reinvention writes itself. Ignore them, and that future still arrives—just without the U.S. in the driver’s seat.

151,Will Crypto Values Survive the Regulatory Wave?,"It is often said that crypto is part technology and part religion. As such, it is hardly surprising that the unfolding regulatory overhaul has been accompanied both by vigorous soul searching related to the state of crypto’s (often anti-establishment) core values and palpable excitement over potential new use cases. With the blessing ofCoinDesk, I asked the panelists of our upcoming people’sregulatory roundtable at Consensus 2025—each of them crypto veterans and advocates for sensible regulation—about safeguarding crypto values in regulatory reform and about the innovation that new regulation is making possible. You can catch Kayvan Sadeghi, Connor Spelliscy, Lewis Cohen, Michelle Ann Gitlitz and David Adlerstein speaking at the People’s Regulatory Roundtable on May 14 at 10 a.m. on the Spotlight Stage. The roundtable will be moderated by Ivo Entchev. If you would like to submit a question ahead of time, please email it to opinion@coindesk.com. This is what they had to say.  Which core crypto values are most important to you and why? How can we ensure that they are respected by regulatory reform? KAYVAN: Individual freedom and sovereignty are core values. Privacy and decentralization are important largely as a means to achieving that sovereignty, which can otherwise be undermined through surveillance and centralized points of control. To ensure that these values are respected, it is helpful to reframe the conversation to focus on the ways in which new technology can achieve the objectives of the existing laws, not just differently, but better. For example, many financial regulations are designed to prevent abuse by those with control over other people’s assets. But as long as humans hold that power, the risk of corruption and greed will persist and the same problems will recur. Heavily regulated intermediaries is one path, but removing the human intermediaries altogether can eliminate the root cause. By analogy, one can curtail drunk-driving with stricter alcohol laws and more frequent roadside checkpoints, but those are band-aids on a problem that can be eliminated with autonomous vehicles. There will be growing pains as new technology is battle-tested, and the risks will look different from the risks of human intermediaries, but the values can be preserved by focusing the discussion around the use of technology to deliver better solutions to problems that the law is already trying to solve.  CONNOR: Blockchain technology can provide users with unprecedented levels of transparency, reliability, and security—as long as policy frameworks allow it to flourish by incentivizing decentralization. If properly regulated, blockchain projects will continue to decentralize, giving users greater control over their finances and digital assets, reducing reliance on overreaching institutions. Beyond financial use cases, decentralized blockchain networks function as infrastructure for a variety of applications that provide users with more autonomy over their lives, including, for example: social media platforms that allow users to own and control their data, community-owned platforms that leverage decentralized governance to compete with Big Tech, and digital identity protocols necessary for users to protect their identity online from sophisticated AI-enabled bots. We believe that focusing on control is the most effective framing option for defining decentralization under law. Meeting a test for control would significantly reduce information asymmetries stemming from the control of a blockchain’s token, justifying lower regulatory burdens or exemptions under securities laws. We recommended specific control principles to implement in ourDesigning Blockchain for a Flourishing Industrypaper we published this week, incorporating feedback from 40+ teams, founders, operators, lawyers, and policymakers.  LEWIS: When we talk about core values, I think about the values of those users and builders who are attracted to the crypto space, rather than the values of a technology as such. These individuals, in my experience, are attracted by many things that certainly include personal sovereignty and decentralization, but are by no means limited to these features. What means the most to me and has driven me forward for the last 10 years, is working with, and serving the needs of, that incredibly diverse community of users and builders - fiercely dedicated to innovation and developing a new “Internet of Value.” We can never forget that, at its heart, “crypto” is a system of tools built from the ground up, not by large corporations, but by individuals contributing their time, energy, and creativity to help make the world a more connected and inclusive place.  MICHELLE: Decentralization is the most important value to me because the distribution of power, control, and decision-making across a network rather than in the hands of central authorities enables true digital ownership and freedom to transact. Where there is centralization and control, we need legal and regulatory safeguards that are reasonably tailored to the particular intricacies of the blockchain-based systems. Ensuring decentralization is respected requires legislators and regulators to truly understand the underlying infrastructure so they can craft rules that protect consumers from loss of funds or value and to safeguard against financial crimes.  DAVID: I’ve been a corporate lawyer for over 20 years and am an ardent believer in free markets. The concept of recognized rights in alienable property, the concept that entrepreneurs should be free to test ideas in the marketplace, and the concept of “freedom of contract”—that consenting adults should be free to enter into exchanges of goods and services as they desire—are all at the heart of U.S. corporate law (and that of other liberal democracies). These concepts are quintessential crypto values.  For all crypto’s novelty, the paradigm of needing reasonable regulatory safeguards around a new technology is an old one. Commercial airplanes were once new tech, and for good reason we have regulations to ensure things like pilot training and safety standards, but these days you can pretty much fly anywhere whenever you want to.  The same paradigm should apply here. I believe it is possible for regulators to preserve openness to new software-based business models and organizational forms, while reasonably tailoring safeguards to prevent things like financial crises and terror financing.  Is regulation opening the door to new and valuable business models/products?  KAYVAN: Sensible regulation could have profound implications for any business driven by community engagement and network effects. Many technologies are lowering the barrier for individuals and small teams to generate and distribute content in competition with larger centralized companies. Effective regulation can further empower individuals by paving the way for good actors to have more direct access to allocation of capital, and for a broader mainstream audience to participate in the ecosystem and benefit from the network effects of the communities in which they participate.  CONNOR: To be determined! We’ve seen a lot more mainstream and institutional interest in blockchain technology now that it appears the space will have clearer parameters as laid out in legislation like a market structure and stablecoin bill but until those bills pass, I think many ambitious and exciting blockchain projects will continue to have a problem scaling. I’m optimistic we’ll be seeing more impactful projects launch in areas like decentralized AI, digital identity, and social media. I’d also love to see legal clarity for novel organizational structures like DAOs so that those types of organizations can continue to experiment and improve; with respect to DAOs, the newly available Wyoming DUNA has proven to be a great step forward.  LEWIS: The door is always open to innovation! Regulation, when it works as it should, facilitates innovation in a balanced and sustainable manner, but is reactive to new business models that the community adopts and actually uses.  I think of regulations in their most ideal form as similar to the development of car travel. Innovators developed the automobile—“horseless carriages” which initially traveled along muddy trails intended for a very different kind of transportation. Seeing this innovation, the government paved and painted lines on roads. Yes, this constrained drivers to some extent, but it also allowed them to travel more safely and go much faster. It was the private sector that took the lead when it came to automobile innovation, designing new kinds of cars with new technologies that travel on those roads.  No matter how well intended at the time, any regulation that seeks to put its finger on the scale and promote one type of technology approach over another usually winds up backfiring in some way and distorting the market. Innovators will continue to create, and regulators should continue to watch over and adapt to these innovations, not lead them.  MICHELLE: I’ve been in the crypto industry for the last 10 years and have worked mostly in heavily regulated areas dealing with financial integrity and consumer protection. I’ve seen new business models and products such as stablecoins proliferate in the ecosystem in the absence of regulatory clarity. Thoughtful regulation enables wider adoption of innovative crypto products with greater confidence by providing clarity to developers and trust amongst users. I’ve also seen more projects in the crypto industry prioritize compliance compared to a decade ago.  As a result, there is a significant opportunity for RegTech solutions to build compliance tooling and processes. We do this every day atChange Agentswhere we are on a mission to streamline workflows, reduce costs and unlock efficiencies using our secure AI-powered automation first platform. Traditional financial institutions often operate on decades-old platforms that were not designed to interface with modern technologies. They struggle with fragmented data stored in disparate systems and formats. Jurisdictions maintain varying approaches to regulation, further complicating these issues.  Crypto platforms inherently facilitate compliance because blockchain technology enables transparent recordkeeping, more automated compliance checks and immutable audit trails. Crypto platforms are also developed with API-first approaches, making integration with RegTech products significantly more straightforward. Finally, crypto companies can oftentimes automate regulatory compliance functions directly from their transaction data rather than manually aggregating data from multiple systems, increasing delays and creating the potential for error. Ultimately, these factors give crypto companies a competitive edge over TradFi because they can better reduce compliance costs while also providing more accurate information to regulators.  DAVID: There are many powerful narratives within crypto, beginning with Bitcoin as a resilient store of value now over 16 years old borderline ancient for technology these days. But I’m particularly excited about stablecoins and tokenization of real-world assets. The potential impact of having a nexus between capital and a fully composable, Turing-complete global computer is not widely understood.  Money is the very lifeblood of commerce, and things like instantaneous payments with little friction and the ability of the unbanked to use digital dollar equivalents, to name just a couple of examples, are only the beginning. Stablecoins are already fairly popular, but impending U.S. regulation will open the door to much more widespread usage. It’s critical to get stablecoin regulation right, with a particular emphasis on minimizing run risk, preserving the ability to combat illicit finance, and promoting interoperability.

153,Reflections on Those MSTR Bitcoin ‘Earnings’,"MSTR earnings came out May 1. My morning media stops last Thursday (hereandhere) asked for a preview. We don't talk about stocks, so I planned to zoom out and hit themes. While preparing, I had to suppress theeye-roll reflexesthat MSTR triggers. MSTR, of course, is the ticker symbol for MicroStrategy, or Strategy, as the company is now known. Strategy, fronted by Michael Saylor, pioneered the “bitcoin treasury” model that’s now been copied by Metaplanet and dozens of other companies.Strategy plans to raise $84 billion, according to its most recent announcement, across equity and fixed income instruments. Here are three questions: 1.Earnings?MSTR ""earnings"" and ""price targets"" are... Well, they don't really mean the same thing, especially once the effect ofASC 2023-08is backed out. It's just the price of bitcoin and financing, plain and simple. Wall Street analysts and pundits should get that right. 2.Strategy?You can't just say, ""Strategy."" You have to say, ""Strategy; you know, it used to be Microstrategy."" Like Prince, Puff Daddy, Kanye West and Twitter. NB: folks say ""strategy"" (small ""s"") a lot already. 3.Don't be a hater?MSTR supports a market cap of $107b with bitcoin holdings of $53b and laser-eyed goodwill. No lifeboat, no parachute, no apparent Plan B. If it fails, the bitcoin market could take the blame. Those eye-rollers (and someobsequious media coverage) notwithstanding, we can agree that: - Thecapital raisesare truly awesome. The force is strong in this one. - MSTR is up 36% on the year, compared to less than 5% for bitcoin. Who am I to throw stones? - MSTR cleverly uses stock price volatility as a feature, not a bug, for 1) issuing mouth-watering converts, 2) attracting listed options volume, and 3) corporate ""yield"" strategies. (Just please stop calling option-selling a ""yield strategy."" And I said ""strategy"" again.Small ""s"".) - The preferreds (STRKandSTRF) hit the mark with some folks who like preferreds. Some of my preferreds friends are smitten. Strategy (big ""S"") has not only created a movement, but a category. Levered MSTR ETFs (includingthis new onewhich pays ""income"") serve the market for whom MSTR's 70 vol is dull. Grayscale announced anETFthat tracks 30 companies that hold at least 100 bitcoin. Last, but not least,Cantor Equity Partners, a SPAC, is merging to form Twenty One Capital, which will hold $3 billion of bitcoin. Mention this trend in a room full of pundits and they'll yell ""Gamestop!"" in unison. It's fun. This is all fine. Adding bitcoin to the treasury of non-crypto companies* is an interesting trend. (And that doesn’t include crypto-native companies, like CoinDesk's parent company, Bullish.) But it's only bitcoin at the moment. Despite the loosening of U.S. regulatory zip-ties on digital assets and the recent flurry of ETF filings, bitcoin still dominates the conversation (it still accounts forabout two-thirdsof the total cryptocurrency market). Again, that's fine if we are talking about a store-of-value asset contributing to a corporate treasury otherwise allocated to cash and treasuries. However, the growing number of flavors of bitcoin exposure--leverage, yield, optionality, protection--are taking the place of education about what other blockchain assets hope to deliver, and why it is important to spend more time thinking about the asset class. Until recently, that was fruitless for many investors and advisors, since brokerage- or futures- account implementation was not available. (Of course, it has been for ETH, but you need more than ETH to think about the ""digital asset class."" Lack of enthusiasm for ETH investment vehicles, we believe, has struggled in part for this reason.) If 2024 was bitcoin's ""coming out"" year, we hope that 2025 gives investors and traders opportunities to think deeper and more broadly, and to implement accordingly. If not, the U.S. crypto investing narrative will start to sound like a ""bitcoin maxi,"" and that feels like leaving money on the table.

JAM is an open-source blockchain protocol that enables the execution of general-purpose computer code on top of blockchain architecture. By removing traditional blockchain-specific coding constraints while maintaining decentralized infrastructure, JAM allows developers to build and run any type of application directly on-chain. This shift paves the way for greater flexibility for developers while preserving the reliability and security that blockchain technology offers. To encourage diverse implementations of the protocol, theWeb3 Foundation launched the JAM Implementer’s Prize, offering up to 10 million DOT and 100,000 KSM, valued at approximately $100 million USD at the time of announcement. Development teams across the globe are working on JAM in various programming languages, fostering a collaborative and pluralistic developer ecosystem. While competing for the prize, these teams are building a growing community where they share knowledge, ideas, and experiences with one another. During ETHLisbon, attendees will have the opportunity to visit the JAM booth, engage directly with implementers, get an early peek behind the curtain at the technology in development, grab exclusive merch, and enjoy a few surprises along the way. On May 9 at 4:30 pm local time on the main stage, Daniel Cukier, a JAM developer working in the Elixir implementation, will also deliver a keynote presentation titled “JAM: The Architecture Web3 Was Meant to Have.” While previous public discussions about JAM have primarily come from Dr. Gavin Wood himself, this event marks a shift as the developer community takes the lead in sharing the project’s vision with a broader audience.

161,"Coinbase Divides Wall Street Analysts After Earnings Miss, Deribit Takeover","Wall Street analysts passed mixed judgement on Coinbase (COIN) after itsfirst-quarter earnings missand a $2.9 billion acquisition, with some downgrading near-term forecasts and others pointing to long-term strategic wins. “Q1 results came in a bit below expectations, and forward-looking guidance for [subscription and service] revenues and April [transaction] volumes were impacted by softer crypto markets and mix/rebates,"" Barclay’s Benjamin Buddish, who maintained an “equal weight” rating, wrote in a report. ""Otherwise, COIN saw nice trading share gains in both spot and futures in Q1, and remains quite optimistic.” The U.S.-based crypto exchange posted a greater-than-forecast 12% drop in revenue from the previous quarter to $2.03 billion. Transaction revenue fell almost 19% to $1.3 billion, raising red flags for the current period. Several analysts, including Keefe, Bruyette & Woods and JPMorgan lowered their second-quarter and full-year revenue projections, citing falling fee rates and lighter institutional activity. Retail trading held steady, but institutional revenue took a hit. JPMorgan flagged the drop in revenue from institutional volume of 30% quarter-over-quarter and a decline in institutional fees from 4.1 to 3.1 basis points, driven by incentives, rebates and a heavier presence of high-frequency traders. Still, the $2.9 billionacquisition of Deribit, the leading global crypto derivatives exchange, stood out as a bold bet on the future of derivatives. The deal, expected to close by year-end, drew praise from Bernstein (with an outperform rating), which called the valuation fair given Deribit’s $1.2 trillion annual volume and $30 billion in open interest. Canaccord Genuity (buy rating) said the acquisition gives Coinbase strength internationally and primes it for eventual U.S. regulatory clearance of crypto options. While trading revenue slumps, the exchange is leaning on other growth levers. Subscription and services revenue grew 9% to $698 million, boosted by stablecoin adoption. USDC balances on Coinbase surged nearly 50% to $12.3 billion and balances held off-platform jumped 39% to $42 billion. Average balances per user have tripled since June 2023, Canaccord noted. The company's strategy also includes expanding its “Coinbase as a service” model — white-label infrastructure for institutions looking to enter the crypto market. Analysts at Canaccord say this could become a key pillar of revenue, offering a hedge against volatile trading cycles. “We have heard plenty of anecdotal data points at this point from TradFi and crypto-native infrastructure players that a buy [versus] build strategy is the most likely scenario if this industry evolves rapidly,” Canaccord analysts said. “Revenue from such types of infrastructure as a service would help smooth trading variability in quarterly numbers while further cementing the company's cornerstone positioning in the market.” Oppenheimer (outperform) and Barclays emphasized macroeconomic risks, including tariff-related uncertainty and weak sentiment that dragged volumes down in April and so far in May. Hopes for regulatory clarity suffered a setback when the GENIUS Act — a stablecoin-focused Senate bill — was blocked earlier this week. Despite that, JPMorgan said management remained optimistic that progress on legislation could resume before the August recess. Coinbase still views itself as central to the evolving crypto ecosystem. While the immediate outlook is clouded by low volumes and squeezed fees, many analysts say the exchange’s broadening product suite, dominant U.S. market position and early-mover advantage in derivatives and infrastructure set it up well for the long term. As Canaccord put it, Coinbase remains the “gold standard” for both institutional and retail entry into digital assets — even if it has to navigate more choppy waters in the short run.

163,Bettors Lose Millions Predicting the New Pope as Polymarket Edge Fizzles Out,"Bettors on crypto prediction platform Polymarket have, in recent months, developed an enviable reputation for beating the bookies. So it came as a surprise on Thursday when they got the outcome of the papal conclave very wrong indeed. Winner Robert Francis Prevost wasn’t among the favorites, with bettors only giving the US-born cardinal around a 1% chance of succeeding Pope Francis ahead of the result. Polymarket bettors, like traditional betting markets, gave Cardinal Pietro Parolin the highest odds, at 28%. With over$28 millionof bets placed on candidates other than Prevost, the result was a total wipeout for many bettors. The event throws into question the perceived heightened accuracy of betting markets like Poymarket over conventional polls. Polymarket lets users bet on the outcomes of everything from soccer fixtures to political elections. Unlike traditional betting platforms, where the house sets the odds based on its best diligence, Polymarket odds are a real-time reflection of the bets placed by users. Simply put, the more demand there is for a certain outcome, the higher the odds and the prices paid for the bets are. In November, Polymarket gained mainstream notoriety when bettors gave Republican candidate Donald Trump significantly higher odds than most other sources to win the US presidency. “Polymarket prices seem to be wrapping up the views of smart money pretty well,” Koleman Stumpf, an economics professor at Wake Forest University in North Carolina,toldCoinDesk at the time, noting that Polymarket bettors appeared to have a slight edge in predicting the election outcome. A historical dataanalysisconducted by New York City-based data scientist Alex McCullough showed Polymarket previously predicted the outcome of world events one month out with 90% accuracy. The reason Polymarket bettors got the papal conclave result so wrong is that the event is extremely hard to predict, Domer, one of Polymarket’s top pseudonymous bettors,saidon X. “It's like walking into a store that doesn't communicate with the outside world,” he said. “Not even the participants themselves would probably know how to handicap it.” Since it’s hard for bettors to find an edge with such an esoteric bet, many likely defaulted to following the opinions of traditional betting markets and the media, resulting in the close alignment of odds between Polymarket and other betting markets likeBetfair. The rarity of papal conclaves may also have made things difficult. Pope Francis, the previous pope, was appointed in 2013, years before blockchain-based betting platforms like Polymarket existed. It's also possible that many Polymarket bettors likely had no prior experience betting on the event. Political elections, where Polymarket odds have lined up closer to results, are much more frequent and widely understood. According to Domer, the real edge in betting on the papal conclave is not choosing the correct candidate but rather betting against those with too-high odds. He chalked up the high odds of heavy favorites Parolin, and Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, who Polymarket bettors gave a 20% chance of winning, to their popularity with the public and the media. ""The pricing for Parolin and Tagle were way too high, and high for not very good reasons,” he said.

164,Market Maker Flowdesk Expands Capital Market Offerings With New Institutional Credit Desk,"Market maker Flowdesk has launched an institutional credit desk, expanding its footprint in digital asset markets as traditional finance players seek more efficient ways to deploy and access capital into crypto. Sophisticated institutional counterparties are seeking structured credit products to manage liquidity, hedge exposure, and generate yield across fragmented venues. Flowdesk’s new desk meets that demand by integrating lending, borrowing, and structured credit into its existing OTC and liquidity infrastructure. “Institutions trading digital assets require more than just efficient execution,” said Reed Werbitt, Flowdesk’s U.S. CEO and chief revenue officer. “They need tools to unlock capital and structure strategies with precision,” he added. The new desk integrates lending, borrowing, and structured credit directly into Flowdesk’s OTC and liquidity services. This rollout comes just two months after Flowdeskraised over $100 millionto expand headcount and build out an over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading desk. “Our mission is to deliver institutional-grade trading solutions for the digital asset ecosystem,” said Guilhem Chaumont, co-founder and Global CEO of Flowdesk in a release. “The launch of our Credit Desk is aligned with our commitment to expanding access to advanced digital asset strategies and robust risk management for a broader range of institutional counterparties,” Chaumont said. Flowdesk’s expansion comes amid increasing U.S. institutional interest in digital assets, and the White House giving the industry a regulatory green light. The trading firm has always been quite bullish on this narrative. Back in 2023, at the height of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) war on crypto, Flowdeskmade the contrarian move to expand its U.S. officeeven as others in the industry were looking offshore. Chaumont said at the time that the size and sophistication of U.S. capital markets made the risk worth it.  Sam Reynolds is a senior reporter based in Asia.

165,"DOGE, XRP, ETH, SOL Follow Bitcoin Through the Cloud as Altcoin Momentum Builds"," This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. About two weeks ago, I discussed bitcoin's (BTC) bullish breakout above a technical resistance called the Ichimoku cloud andpotential for a rally to $100,000. This week, the cryptocurrency obligingly surged into six figures. Now, top alternative cryptocurrencies such as memecoinDOGE, payments-focusedXRP, the Ethereum blockchain's ether (ETH) and Solana'sSOLhave also crossed above the cloud, flashing bullish signals. The analysis, developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s, is used to identify support and resistance, momentum and trend change in price actions. The indicator comprises five lines: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K), and a lagging closing price line. The gap between the first two lines makes the cloud. Crossovers above and below the Ichimoku cloud are taken to represent bullish and bearish shifts in momentum. The chart shows XRP and DOGE moving above their respective Ichimoku clouds, signaling more gains. In XRP's case, the breakout shifts focus to resistance at around 30 cents, characterized by the trendline falling from February highs. DOGE is trading close to its bear market trendline, which, if topped, would expose resistance at $3.02, the lower high created on March 2. In ETH's case, the breakout has opened the doors to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,700. Meanwhile, SOL may encounter resistance at $218, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the January to April sell-off.

166,Bitcoin Miner MARA Stock Surges Despite Earnings Miss as Analysts Applaud Cost Cutting,"Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings (MARA) stock outperformed peers on Friday, even after itsfirst quarter resultsmissed Wall Street's estimates, as the company's focus on lowering costs is seen as positive by analysts. Jefferies analysts said that with the bitcoinBTC$103,339.18price improving in the second quarter of this year and MARA focusing on more sustainable energy sources such as solar and flared gas-driven data centers, power costs should come down in the coming quarters and help margins. ""MARA is expanding infrastructure at its 114 MW wind farm and has fully energized its 25 MW micro flared gas data center, both of which should drive down power costs,"" said analyst Jonathan Petersen in a note. If the mining firm continues to buy up more of such power sources, it would help the company's profitability, Petersen wrote. ""Continued acquisition of power assets is expected to further reduce energy costs, expand margins, and better prepare the firm for the next halving."" Peterson reiterated his hold rating on the stock, while raising the price target to $16 from $13. Bitcoin mining, once a very profitable business, has seen its profit margins crash drastically during the last bear market and even more so after the recent halving that cut the rewards by half. To make matters worse, rising power costs for mining have continued to plague the margins. This squeeze has forced most miners to diversify their business into other sources of revenue, including hosting artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) data centers. MARA was among the few miners that didn't jump into the AI sector right away, but rather focused on other avenues of diversification, such astransaction revenue services,mining pool,buying bitcoinin the open market andlowering power costsvia green energy sources. The last point about lower power cost seemed to have struck a chord with the market. H.C. Wainwright analyst Kevin Dede said that this is what separates MARA from its mining peers: ""Commentary last night made it clear the company remains focused on technology development in its core vertical of power conversion ... with a peeled eye on driving energy costs to zero."" ""We rehash this here in distancing MARA's strategy against mining competitors gently or forcefully migrating their mining businesses to address the rapidly evolving HPC opportunity,"" he said. Dede, who has a buy rating and price target of $28, also seemed to echo the sentiment that MARA will be able to lower costs by focusing on these types of power sources. ""Our opinion on that aside for now, we agree with MARA's overarching objective to create opportunities by exploiting unused power or improving the efficiency of used power,"" he said. MARA's shares rose as much as 9% on Friday, while the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) has fallen about 0.3%.

So much so that he is now one of the sector’s largest proponents, foraying into memecoins, DeFi, NFTs, and even stablecoins. A new report by the StateDemocracy Defenders Fundestimates that Trump’s family has increased their net worth by $2.9 billion thanks to crypto, and that now 40% of that net worth is being held in crypto assets. His deepening ties to the industry have reverberated across the political landscape, to the point that a broadly bipartisan stablecoinbill failed in a key vote Thursdayafter Democrats expressed concern about the extent to which he is profiting off the sector. Trump's support helped spark a continued bull market after his election victory in November, a market that's been dominated by two trends: memecoins and institutional adoption of bitcoin via ETFs. While the latter is the province of, generally, institutional investors and providers, it's the memecoin business that puts retail investors at risk and is potentially ripe for exploitation. On Thursday, Solidus Labs claimed that98% of memecoinsissued on the token creation platform pump.fun were rug pulls or pump-and-dump schemes. The platform has since refuted the report's claims. Another analysis by Chainalysis, cited byCNBC, suggested that the vast majority of TRUMP token holders lost money. A memecoin is a type of crypto token with no inherent value, often based, as the name suggests, on a meme or cartoon character. Popular examples of this are dogecoin (DOGE), shiba inu (SHIB) and pepe (PEPE). The craze reached a climax in January when Trump touted his own TRUMP token on social media, followed by MELANIA— named after his wife. TRUMP, which hit a day-one peak of $77.26, is now trading at $10.80, down a whopping 86%. MELANIA slumped even further, losing more than 97% of its value in four months to trade recently at 33 cents. The hype around Trump’s social media post led to a flurry of trading activity.Datafrom Chainalysis reveals that 760,000 wallets, mainly belonging to retail investors, lost money on the TRUMP token. A small group of people, however, was immune to those losses. The Chainanalysis data show 58 wallets made profits in excess of $10 million. The token’s creators netted a whopping $320 million in trading fees, although it’s worth noting that around 5% of the fees went to the decentralized exchange Meteora, which hosted the launch. MELANIA was allegedly scooped up by a group of insiders before it was advertised on social media in a technique known as “sniping.” This group of insiders made $100 million on MELANIA tokens by swapping tokens for USDC after its price doubled, according to aninvestigationby the Financial Times. One insider with access to the tokens before they went live was Kelsier Ventures’ Hayden Davis, who revealed his involvement during an interview in February. Davis was also the brains behind the botched LIBRA stablecoin thatbrought political chaosto Argentina. In an interview with Coffeezilla in February, Davis said: “This is going to put me in a lot of danger. Which is fine, I’ll answer. I was a part of it [MELANIA]. I think the team did want to snipe it because of how big the snipe was on TRUMP. We definitely weren’t the big sniper, that was what we were trying to avoid. We didn’t take any liquidity out, zero.” Trump’s foray into crypto isn't limited to memecoins. The U.S. president’s family is also behind World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform thatraised around $590 millionacross two pre-sale rounds earlier this year. It raised funds at a time when the market was resting around all-time highs, so that figure of raised crypto is now much less.Arkham Intelligence datasuggests that World Liberty Financial holds around $103 million worth of crypto. Trump also attempted to ride the coattails of non-fungible token (NFT) hype in 2022, releasing a series of cartoons depicting the president as a superhero or a cartoon character. Trump made around $8 million from rolling out these NFTs, according tofinancial disclosures. Most recently, there was the crypto dinner event, which saw Trump host a group of 25 TRUMP holders to a private dinner and tour of his Virginia golf club. A Bloombergreportreveals that 19 of those 25 holders were either foreign entities or used an offshore exchange banned in the U.S. He's set to host another dinner for the top 220 holders of his token later in May. U.S. Senators Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.called forTrump’s impeachment, asking the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to investigate whether Trump violated federal ethics rules by inviting top investors. The Trump family did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.

169,Meta Is Looking to Enter Red-Hot Stablecoin Market: Fortune,"Tech giant Meta (META) is looking to use stablecoin to manage payouts,Fortune reported, citing five sources familiar with the matter. Meta has also hired a vice president of product, Ginger Baker, who has crypto experience to help with its stablecoin efforts, Fortune said. The company's foray back into crypto is worth noting, given that its 2019 blockchain project Libra, later renamed Diem,came to a crashing halt in 2022, after intense regulatory scrutiny. If Meta goes through with this project, it will enter the sector at a time when stablecoins—digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar—are becoming the hottest trend among crypto and TradFi firms. Companies such as Ripple, Mastercard, Visa, Dutch bank ING and Stripe are all joining the stablecoin industry. In fact, Standard Chartered said the stablecoin market couldgrow by $2 trillionby the end of 2028. However, lawmakers in the U.S. are also scrutinizing stablecoins. A vote to open a floor debate on a bill regulating this sector of the crypto industry failed earlier Thursday after lawmakers expressed concerns about some of the bill's consumer protection and legal provisions, as well as about U.S. President Donald Trump's own foray into stablecoins through World Liberty Financial's USD1.

170,Superstate Expands Into Tokenized Equities; SOL Strategies to Be First Listing,"Superstate, the tokenized asset management firm behind the $650 million USTB token, is moving into stock tokenization with a new blockchain-based marketplace for public equities, first available on Solana (SOL).The platform, called Opening Bell and unveiled on Wednesday, allows companies to create tokenized versions of SEC-registered shares—not derivatives or synthetic assets—and trade directly on blockchain rails. Unlike current practices that rely on centralized stock exchanges and multi-day settlements, Opening Bell supports real-time, around-the-clock trading and programmable securities. The platform targets both already public firms on traditional stock exchanges and late-stage private companies seeking access to liquidity. Canadian investment firm SOL Strategies said it plans to be the first issuer on the platform, listing its stock for on-chain trading on Solana pending regulatory approval. Tokenization has become one of the hottest trends in finance. Asset managers and even central banks are experimenting with putting real-world assets—bonds, funds, equities—onto blockchains to improve efficiency and broaden access. It's a huge opportunity: tokenized assets are projected to become a multitrillion-dollar market this decade, according to reports byMcKinsey,BCG,21SharesandBernstein. While the technology is advancing quickly, industry leaders including BlackRock’s Larry Fink and Robinhood’s Vlad Tenev have urged regulators to provide clearer guidelines. The SEC plans to hold aroundtableon tokenization next week, with Superstate general partner Alex Zozos expected to join the discussion. Superstate registered its digital transfer agent with the SEC earlier this year, laying groundwork to align tokenized securities with the current regulatory framework.

171,Sei Wants to Cut Cosmos Compatibility and Go All-In on Ethereum,"A Sei Network developer proposed to depreciate the blockchain’s Cosmos support on Wednesday in a bid to remove “unnecessary” complexity for users. The proposal, if successful, will make it so Sei users will only be able to send and receive transactions that are compatible with Ethereum. Cutting Cosmos support will significantly simplify the blockchain, reduce infrastructure overhead, and position Sei more strongly within the broader Ethereum ecosystem, Philip Su, Sei Labs’ Engineering Lead,saidin the proposal. “This transition will lead to greater adoption, improved developer experience, and a more cohesive community,” he said. The move comes as blockchain infrastructure builders compete to draw in developers and expand their orbits. Ethereum-based infrastructure, which runs on software called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, is what the majority of decentralized finance apps run on. Ethereum, as well as other big blockchains like Coinbase’s Base and the Binance-affiliated BNB Chain, all use the EVM. But there are challengers. Solana uses its own software called the Solana Virtual Machine, or SVM, while Cosmos has pioneered software called CosmWasm. Sei currently supports both EVM and CosmWasm. “While this dual architecture has provided flexibility, it also introduces significant complexity and friction for both users and developers,” Su said. If Sei pivots away from CosmWasm it could be a significant blow for the software’s adoption. The Sei Network has grown steadily since its 2023 launch. Deposits to DeFi apps on the network are at an all-time high of $1 billion, according to DefiLlamadata, making it the 15th largest blockchain by total value locked. Barry Plunkett, co-CEO of Interchain Labs, the development and growth team for Cosmos, told CoinDesk that even if Sei cuts Cosmos support, it is still a Cosmos-based blockchain. Users and developers will still be able to take advantage of some Cosmos features, like staking and governance, he said. When Sei launched it didn’t support the EVM and adoption was slow. Over the blockchain’s first year it only attracted some $50 million of deposits to its DeFi apps, a paltry sum compared to other blockchains that launched around the same time, such as Sui, which soared above $600 million in deposits during its first year. But that changed in July 2024 when Sei launched its second version, which let users create DeFi apps using either CosmWasm or the EVM. Activity exploded as developers and investors flocked to the blockchain. Among DeFi developers, the EVM is the most well-known software. So by introducing EVM support, Sei was able to tap into a much larger pool of developers. New Sei users are now predominantly choosing to use the EVM instead of CosmWasm,datacompiled by Sei Labs on data platform Dune Analytics shows. What’s more, the current cross-compatibility comes at a cost, Su said. It introduces “unnecessary overhead in the codebase and complicates debugging and testing,” he said. Still, there’s no guarantee others in the Sei community will feel the same way. Build with Sei, a group managed by the nonprofit Sei Foundation, willhosta call on May 14 to discuss the proposal in detail and give opportunities for developers and the community to ask questions and give feedback.

Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap-up of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, the Ethereum protocol reporter on CoinDesk’s Tech team. In this issue: PECTRA FINALLY GOES LIVE ON ETHEREUM:Ethereum activated its long-awaited “Pectra” upgrade on Wednesday, marking the blockchain’s most significant overhaul since the Merge in 2022. The update aims to streamline staking, enhance wallet functionality, and improve overall efficiency. It arrives as Ethereum contends with rising competition and internal debates over its direction. A key element of the upgrade involves increasing the amount of ETH one can stake from 32 to 2,048. This change could help speed up and streamline operations for stakers, the vast network of companies and individuals who help keep the Ethereum network afloat. Previously, staking at scale required setting up multiple validators; now, stakers can consolidate up to that amount under a single node. —Margaux NijkerkRead more.

174,Why One of Uniswap DAO’s Most Outspoken Members Just Walked Away in Frustration,"One of the Uniswap DAO’s top contributors walked away in frustration on Monday amid concerns that other stakeholders wield too much power over the decentralised protocol.  Pepo, a pseudonymous delegate whom other token holders entrusted to vote on their behalf, had participated in Uniswap’s governance since 2023. Hewielded455,000 UNI tokens, making him one of the top 20 largest delegates.  The reason for the departure? Other organisations involved in the running of Uniswap — primarily the nonprofit Uniswap Foundation — have pushed aside the opinions of DAO members and have been unreceptive to feedback, Peposaidin an X post.  “The Foundation’s behavior seems to have prioritized insulation over collaboration, and in doing so, may have actively harmed Uniswap,” Pepo said.  Devin Walsh, Executive Director of the Uniswap Foundation, didn't provide direct comment to CoinDesk when asked about the accusation. However, she did provide a rebuttal on social media.  “Delegate participation is essential to the success of the Uniswap ecosystem,” shesaidon X. “The Uniswap Foundation takes their feedback seriously.”  Uniswap is the biggest decentralized exchange with some$4 billion worth of deposits, down 60% from its peak of nearly $10 billion total-value-locked during 2021-2022,according to DefiLlama data.   Like many DeFi protocols, Uniswap is controlled and managed through a somewhat byzantine structure.  The protocol was created by Uniswap Labs, a for-profit company which is also responsible for its continued development. The Uniswap Foundation, a nonprofit, is tasked with supporting Uniswap and its community, while protocol changes and allocation of resources is controlled by the Uniswap DAO, a type of crypto collective governed by holders of the UNI token.  In March, the DAOgrantedthe foundation $165 million to boost Uniswap ecosystem growth and development. This gave the foundation a mandate to do certain things in pursuit of its goals without directly consulting the DAO.  Some, like Pepo, feel the Uniswap Foundation’s actions are putting the DAO’s interests behind those of itself and Uniswap Labs.  This situation highlights the persistent struggle to balance the interests of DeFi protocol token holders with those of other stakeholders. Pepo isn’t the only one to highlight a perceived lack of DAO control at Uniswap.  In October, Billy Gao, vice president of Stanford Blockchain Club, a Uniswap delegate,saidUniswap Labs’ sudden decision to launch its own blockchain “raised serious questions about DAO governance.”  Gao argued that the Uniswap DAO should have been told about the blockchain ahead of time and allowed to weigh in on key decisions in its implementation. “It calls to question (once again) how decentralized [Uniswap’s] governance actually is,” he said.  Uniswap Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Others have questioned how the Uniswap Foundation uses the funds granted to it, and have complained that it isn’t transparent enough about its spending and decision making.  “Transparency and communication are values that many delegates agree with,” Doo Wan Nam, Co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab, a Uniswap delegate, told CoinDesk. “There have been improvements.”  On May 1, the Uniswap Foundation responded to criticism bycreatinga Foundation Feedback Group, intended to ensure effective communication and strengthen accountability between the foundation and the DAO.  Additionally, as a nonprofit company, the foundation must legallypublishits finances.  But the problem is that for some delegates, it’s not enough.  “It’s a loss for any DAO whenever a delegate feels the only way to make an impact is through stepping down,” PaperImperium, Governance Liaison at Uniswap DAO delegate GFX Labs, told CoinDesk. Some governance participants also complained that a lot of Uniswap DAO communication and decision-making happens privately, instead of publicly on the Uniswap governance forums.  This has led tocomplaintsthat major decisions are all agreed on by large delegates behind closed doors before going to a public vote.  It’s necessary for proposals to receive a degree of feedback before being presented publicly, Nam said.  It’s not unlike traditional governance. “Congressmen won't just blindly write bills without talking to relevant stakeholders or other Congressmen,” Nam said.  But it’s a double-edged sword. As DAOs mature, there’s also a sense that they are becoming more about politics and appearances rather than pursuing what’s best for the protocol.  Multiple Uniswap delegates declined to comment to CoinDesk when asked about the complaints highlighted by Pepo.

175,"Ethereum Activates ‘Pectra’ Upgrade, Raising Max Stake to 2,048 ETH","Ethereum activated its long-awaited “Pectra” upgrade on Wednesday, marking the blockchain’s most significant overhaul since the Merge in 2022.  The update aims to streamline staking, enhance wallet functionality, and improve overall efficiency. It arrives as Ethereum contends with rising competition and internal debates over its direction.  The Pectra upgrade, a ""hard fork"" in blockchain parlance, was triggered at 10:05 UTC and finalized around 13 minutes later.  A key element of the upgrade involves increasing the amount of ETH one can stake from 32 to 2,048. This change could help speed up and streamline operations for stakers, the vast network of companies and individuals who help keep the Ethereum network afloat.  Previously, staking at scale required setting up multiple validators; now, stakers can consolidate up to that amount under a single node.  The upgrade, considered to be Ethereum's biggest since the2022 Merge to proof-of-stake, comes at a delicate moment for the ecosystem. It followstwo failed test runs, one of which put a key Ethereum test networkpermanently out of commission.  Additionally, Ethereum, the network that introduced smart contracts and blockchain-based decentralized applications, has steadily lost market share to more nimble competitors in recent months.  Solana, in particular, hasattracted more new developersover the last year than Ethereum, which was long considered the dominant non-Bitcoin blockchain.  The Ethereum communityhas debated whether its unofficial leader — the non-profit Ethereum Foundation — is to blame for the lagging price of the ETH token, and the perception within the industry that the network lacks a cohesive vision.  In response, the Swiss foundationintroduced new leadershipand a fresh set of plans to reinvigorate the chain's developer community.  Central to the upgrade is EIP-7251, whichincreases the maximum amount validators can stakefrom 32 to 2,048 ETH.  The change is intended to assist staking institutions and infrastructure providers by addressing the needs of validators whostake ETHto keep the chain operational. If you want to invest more than 32 ETH with the network, you must divide your stake among dozens—or sometimes, hundreds—of separate nodes.  This not only consumes time and incurs costs, but it has also resulted in weeks-long lines for new nodes to join the network.  By upping the staking limit, ""This means that small operators can compound their stake directly, while large ones can consolidate validators to reduce bandwidth use on the p2p network,” wrote Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation,over X.  Another core component of the hard fork, EIP-7702, would allow crypto wallets totemporarily function as smart contracts. This change brings the Ethereum network closer toaccount abstraction, a series of features that pave the way for more user-friendly crypto wallets.  Users could, for instance, pay transaction fees in stablecoins instead of ETH, set up an automatic payments system, or introduce recovery access to wallets if they forget their seed phrases.  While EIP-7251 and EIP-7702 are the main focuses of Pectra, nine other Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) have made it into the package, mostly affecting staking providers, validators, and developers:  Read more:Ethereum Preps for Biggest Code Change Since the Merge With Pectra Upgrade  UPDATE (10:22 UTC): Updates to state that Pectra upgrade has finalized.

176,Samourai Wallet Prosecutors Say Delayed FinCEN Disclosure Wasn’t a Brady Violation,"Prosecutors in the Samourai Wallet case have denied accusations that they suppressed critical evidence in their criminal case against the crypto mixing service’s two co-founders, Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill.  In a letter to the court filed Friday, prosecutors urged Judge Richard Berman of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) to deny Rodriguez and Hill’s recent motion for a hearing to litigate the government’s tardy disclosure of a conversation between prosecutors and the Financial Services Enforcement Network (FinCEN). In that conversation, which took place six months before charges were filed, FinCEN officials told prosecutors that Samourai Wallet didn’t meet their definition of a money transmitting business and thus didn’t need a license to operate.  Despite FinCEN’s guidance, prosecutors went ahead with their case, charging both Rodriguez and Hill with one count each of conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. Through Samourai Wallet, prosecutors have alleged that the two men “intentionally and successfully laundered over $100 million in crime proceeds of all types” and explicitly marketed their services to “Dark/Gray Market Participants” including hackers and fraudsters.  By not telling the defense about their communication with FinCEN until last month, lawyers for Rodriguez and Hill say the government violated due process — a so-called Brady violation, named for the landmark Supreme Court case Brady v. Maryland in 1963, in which the court held that the government must hand over any exculpatory or material evidence (basically, anything suggesting that the defendant isn’t actually guilty of the crime they’ve been charged with) to the defense in a timely manner.  However, prosecutors have denied that they’ve committed any Brady violations in the Samourai Wallet case. In their letter to the judge, they laid out a host of reasons that the timing of their disclosure of the FinCEN conversation was fair play. First, they argued that their conversation with the FinCEN employees represented their “individual, informal and caveated opinions” on whether Samourai Wallet would have been required to register as a money transmitting business, rather than a formal finding by the regulator itself.  “Courts have repeatedly held that these types of legal opinions — or opinions of any kind — are not Brady material; facts are Brady material,” prosecutors wrote.  Prosecutors also said that, even if the material were relevant to the defense’s case, they had turned it over to the defense seven months ahead of trial, writing: “There is no need for court intervention when the defendants have received discovery materials sufficiently in advance of trial to effectively use the information.”  In their own letter to the court earlier this week, lawyers for Samourai Wallet said that their clients had been unfairly prejudiced by the government’s lack of disclosure, arguing that it could have impacted the magistrate judge’s bail decision or the court’s ruling on an early motion to dismiss the case entirely.  Prosecutors pushed back against this argument, saying that the bulk of the case against Samourai Wallet was not tied to the money transmitting charge and was instead tied to Rodriguez and Hill’s alleged money laundering scheme — the more serious of the two charges against them, carrying a hefty 20 year maximum prison sentence.  The back-and-forth over the potential Brady violation comes after the defense asked prosecutors to drop their case under the auspices of the so-called Blanche Memo, arecent memofrom Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, ordering U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) staff to narrow their crypto enforcement priorities. Under the Blanche memo, prosecutors were ordered to stop pursuing litigation against crypto exchanges or mixing services for the actions of their end users.  Following the request, prosecutors met with the defense to consider the request on April 10. Nearly a month later, the government still has not reached a decision either way, which some former SDNY prosecutors have characterized as unusual in conversations with CoinDesk.

179,"SEC, Ripple Ink $50M Settlement Agreement, Ask NY Judge for Green Light","Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have officially reached a deal that, if approved by a judge, will bring their years-long legal battle to a close.  According to a settlement agreement filed in New York on Thursday, both parties have agreed to a $50 million penalty — a portion of the $125 million fine initially imposed last year by Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York (SDNY), and a tiny fraction of the massive $2 billion fine initially requested by the SEC.  In her 2023 ruling, Judge Torres found that Ripple violated securities laws in selling its native XRP token to institutional investors, but did not violate securities laws in putting XRP on exchanges for retail customers to buy in a suit originally brought in 2020 under then-SEC Chair Jay Clayton (who's now the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York).  The SEC, then under the leadership of former Chair Gary Gensler, appealed Torres’ ruling, prompting Ripple to cross-appeal. Under the settlement agreement, both parties agree to drop their cases. The Thursday filing confirms Ripple’s announcement in March that it had reached an in-principle settlement agreement with the SEC.

180,Celsius Founder Alex Mashinsky Sentenced to 12 Years in Prison for Fraud,"NEW YORK, NY — Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius Network, was sentenced to 12 years in prison on Thursday for fraud.  Judge John Koeltl of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) handed down the sentence, saying the 12 years — composed of a 120-month sentence to be served concurrently with a separate 144-month sentence for the two charges Mashinsky pled guilty to — reflected Mashinsky’s “extremely serious” crimes. The sentence splits the difference between the mere one year and a day in prison requested by his defense team, and the 20 years suggested by prosecutors. He has also agreed to forfeit $48 million and several pieces of real estate.  “No matter what the sentence, the sentence will not cure the monetary or psychological harm caused to the victims,” Koeltl said.  Before Celsius’ collapse in 2022, Mashinsky repeatedly lied to investors about the safety of their deposits. He falsely claimed that Celsius had regulatory approval, he insisted that the platform did not make uncollateralized loans when, in fact, it did, and he lied about selling his CEL tokens while manipulating the price for his own financial gain – making over $48 million in profit from CEL alone, prosecutors said. Mashinsky’s poor leadership and self-dealing drove Celsius into bankruptcy, leaving a gaping $1.2 billion hole — which prosecutors said is more like $7 billion at today’s prices — in the company’s balance sheet.  When Celsius did collapse, over 100,000 creditors claimed they lost a collective $4.7 billion according to initial bankruptcy documents.  “Alexander Mashinsky targeted retail investors with promises that he would keep their ‘digital assets’ safer than a bank, when in fact he used those assets to place risky bets and to line his own pockets,” U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a statement. “In the end, Mashinsky made tens of millions of dollars while his customers lost billions. America’s investors deserve better. The case for tokenization and the use of digital assets is strong but it is not a license to deceive. The rules against fraud still apply, and the SDNY will hold those who flout them accountable for their crimes.”  In both their pre-sentencing documents and in their testimony in court on Thursday, Mashinsky and his lawyers attempted to downplay the one-time CEO’s role in the fraud. His lawyers told the court that Mashinsky “has not a malicious bone in his body” and that the government’s attempt to characterize him as the architect of a fraud scheme was “a hoax.”  Mashinsky wept as his lawyer, Marc Mukasey, told the court of his personal characteristics — including his military service in the Israeli army, his alleged track record of hiring homeless people to work at his various companies and, bafflingly, about his ongoing work on a non-fiction book about gravity since his arrest — which he urged the judge to consider as mitigating factors for Mashinsky’s sentence. When Mashinsky himself spoke to the judge, he cried intermittently as he apologized for the harm caused to his victims.  “As someone who came from nothing, I recognize how hard people work to earn, save and invest in crypto,” Mashinsky said. “I respectfully ask the victims for forgiveness and I apologize to all of them for my mistakes. I’m truly sorry.”  Six of those victims spoke in court on Thursday, detailing their pain and suffering in the aftermath of Celsius’ collapse.  One victim, Cameron Crewes, told the court that Mashinsky and his lawyers’ spin on his conduct was a “horrific minimization” of the damage he caused at Celsius.  “Defense says he’s working on a new book about gravity, but he seems not to understand the gravity of the situation,” Crewes said, adding that at least 231 Celsius creditors have died since the platform’s collapse, and will never be made whole.  Another creditor, Hollis Waite, described how he was “woefully unprepared” to send his two young children to college after losing a significant chunk of his savings in Celsius. Yet another, Hugh Mitton, told the court that he’d lost sleep, his mental health, and his time since Celsius’ collapse. Mitton took issue with Mashinsky’s lawyers’ characterization that he was voluntarily missing his son’s college graduation, also on Thursday, in order to attend his sentencing and take responsibility for his crimes.  “[He] doesn’t make mention of all the people who can no longer afford to send their kids to university,” Mitton said.  Both victims and prosecutors pointed to Mashinsky’s continued failure to take real accountability for the actions that led to Celsius’ downfall, as well as the financial gain he and his wife Krissy made from Celsius, even during its collapse and subsequent bankruptcy – after which Krissy sold t-shirts saying “Unbankrupt Yourself,” a spin on Celsius’ “Unbank Yourself” slogan.  Mashinsky was stone-faced as he listened to his victims’ testimony. When the judge handed down the sentence, he seemed genuinely surprised, saying:  “I feel that while I am here to take responsibility, I am taking responsibility for a thousand employees. Not one of them has come forward to say what they have done. That’s it, your honor.”  As part of his plea agreement, Mashinsky is unable to appeal his sentence. He was ordered to self-report to prison to start his sentence in September. His lawyers requested that he be allowed to serve his sentence at FCI Otisville, a medium-security prison in New York that's also a temporary home to Mango Markets exploiter Avi Eisenberg, who wasrecently sentenced to four years in prison for the possession of child pornography.  If he serves the entirety of his sentence, Mashinsky will be 72-years-old upon release. On the news team at CoinDesk, Cheyenne focuses on crypto regulation and crime.
