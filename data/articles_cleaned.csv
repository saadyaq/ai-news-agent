183,"Analysis: Coinbase Is Buying Bitcoin, Just Don’t Call It a Treasury Strategy.","Coinbase (COIN) has its own strategy for BTC on the corporate balance sheet, but it's not a bitcoin maximalist play like
that of Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR).
On the company's first quarter 2025 earnings call, CFO Alesia Haas revealed that Coinbase purchased $150 million in
crypto, “predominantly bitcoin,” bringing its long-term investment portfolio to $1.3 billion, or 25% of net cash.
Haas, however, went out of her way to draw a line between Coinbase and firms that explicitly tie their corporate
identity to holding bitcoin on the balance sheet.
“To be clear, we're an operating company,” she said. “But we do invest alongside the space.”
In other words, Coinbase isn’t betting the company on bitcoin.On a Q&A callwith retail investors, Armstrong said there
was a temptation in its early days to put a lot of BTC on the balance sheet, but it was too risky. Crypto is volatile
and, at the time, Coinbase was too young of a company to take that risk.
Now, as a listed giant things have changed, but there's still not a need to go all-in on bitcoin. Coinbase is allocating
profits from operations back into crypto assets, similarly to how a commodity firm might accumulate raw materials it
understands deeply. The move is less Michael Saylor and more sector-aligned capital recycling.
In fact, Coinbase didn’t even trumpet the purchase in its shareholder letter. The news only surfaced in response to a
retail shareholder's question about “accruing hard crypto reserve assets.”
CEO Brian Armstrong didn’t speak directly about the purchases, but he did offer a philosophical context. Coinbase, he
reminded investors, isn’t dabbling in crypto – it is crypto.
“We’ve been focused on crypto since the beginning, 12 years ago, and we continue to be focused there,” Armstrong said.
“Crypto is eating financial services.”
For Armstrong, buying BTC is a byproduct of conviction and operational alignment and not a headline play, treasury
pivot, or activist bet.
Coinbase isn’t holding BTC to signal to markets some broader conviction, or become a proxy like MSTR. Behind the
accounting language is something deeper: a long-view bet that holding Bitcoin, like building the rails beneath it, is
simply part of Coinbase's job.
That's not a treasury strategy — it's something in the middle.

185,State of Crypto: Mapping Out the Senate Stablecoin Bill's Next Steps,"House Republicans unveiled a discussion draft of a market structure bill but all eyes this week were on the Senate,
where a largely bipartisan effort to advance stablecoin legislation ran up against a wall.

PS: I'll be in Toronto next week for Consensus. In town? Come say hi.

You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government.Click
hereto sign up for future editions.

Stablecoin and market structure bills are the two big things around crypto that Congress is expected to get to President
Donald Trump's desk this year. There was a press conference by crypto and AI czar David Sacks with the chairs of the
House and Senate committees. Everyone had this rough deadline of ""before the August recess.""
Of these two bills, the stablecoin legislation was supposed to be the easier lift. It's focused on just a part of the
crypto sector, while the market structure bill will define how a much broader part of the industry operates and is
overseen by federal regulators. And up until just over a week ago, the stablecoin bill was largely sailing through with
few issues. Now — while it's still expected to become law — the timing of its passage is far less certain.
First thing's first: No one this reporter has spoken to this week thinks the Senate's stablecoin bill — the Guiding and
Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act — is dead. According to multiple individuals familiar
with the situation, lawmakers were already back to negotiating afterThursday's failed vote, and lawmakers could vote
again as soon as next week — potentially even Monday.

Thursday's vote failed after Democratsraised an alarm last weekendthat certain provisions around national security, the
soundness of the financial system and accountability, thoughRepublicans arguedthat ongoing stablecoin usage requires
swift passage. U.S. President Donald Trump's profiting off of stablecoins also raised alarm bells for lawmakers,
senators introducingmultiple billsthat would prevent the President from issuing financial assets, including the ""End
Crypto Corruption Act,"" which would block all members of Congress, the president, vice president, other executive branch
officials and their families from ""issuing, endorsing or sponsoring crypto assets.""

On Wednesday, one individual told CoinDesk that it appeared that a deal might be in place so that Democrats would get a
vote on the End Crypto Corruption Act, either as an amendment to the GENIUS Act or as a standalone bill, ahead of the
procedural vote on the GENIUS Act itself.

This ultimately did not happen, with lawmakers proceeding directly to the so-called cloture vote on Thursday; it fell
48-49.

The vote did not fail on party lines either: though no Democrats voted in favor of the bill,Republicans Josh Hawley and
Rand Pauljoined 46 Democrats in voting against the motion (Majority Leader John Thune initially voted in favor of the
bill, but flipped in a procedural move that will let him bring the bill back for a vote later).

Among other issues was the fact that there was no bill text available at the time the vote kicked off.

The cloture vote, which would open 30 hours of debate, is likely the main piece of leverage Democrats have to try and
get their priorities into the bill because it needs 60 Senators to pass. After the debate, there will be another cloture
vote before the final passage vote, but it would be difficult for a lawmaker who voted to open debate to walk that back
afterward, one of the individuals told CoinDesk.

Having their priorities sorted before getting to the final set of votes would also just generally provide more comfort
to lawmakers, the individual said.

None of the individuals who spoke to CoinDesk expect that an actual provision blocking the U.S. President from issuing
or being tied to an issuer of a stablecoin will become part of the final bill.

One of the individuals said ongoing negotiations are more focused on how foreign issuers are treated and anti-money
laundering provisions.

A broader concern was that a hefty delay in passing the stablecoin legislation may slow down the process for advancing
the market structure bill, which will rewrite the law around how the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities
and Exchange Commission oversee digital assets, including how cryptocurrencies might be defined as securities. A
discussion draftwas introducedin the House this week.

If the Senate votes on the stablecoin bill in the next week or so, it should not hold up the other bill, two individuals
told CoinDesk.

186,Lido Proposes a Bold Governance Model to Give stETH Holders a Say in Protocol Decisions,"Lido Finance, Ethereum’s largest liquid staking platform by locked value, has introduced a proposal that grants staked
ether (stETH) holders direct voting power alongside existing DAO tokenholders.
The upgrade, dubbed Lido Improvement Proposal (LIP) 28, outlines a dual governance system allowing stETH holders — those
who stake ETH via Lido and receive a liquid token in return — to participate in a veto mechanism on key protocol
decisions. Currently, only holders ofLDO$1.11, Lido’s governance token, have a say in how the protocol evolves.
Under the new system, stETH holders could veto certain proposals approved by LDO tokenholders, though the veto would not
enable them to push proposals through unilaterally.
Dual Governance: Coming SoonYears in the making, Lido DAO contributors are proud to present an outline for the upcoming
release of Dual Governance featuring design & code choices, parameters, deployment & rollout.https://t.co/Iu7J1cOlcr
The proposed system is framed as a mechanism to increase accountability and decentralization, especially as Lido
continues to dominate Ethereum’s staking landscape. Over25% of all ETHis staked on the network running through its
infrastructure.
The Dual Governance system adds a special timelock contract between Lido DAO’s decisions and their execution, giving
stETH holders a way to intervene if they strongly oppose a proposal.
The ""dynamic"" time lock is necessary because it is how on-chain governance technically works behind the scenes.
In the current system, decisions don’t take effect right away, as there is a set period before they’re executed. That
gives users time to react if they don't agree with certain changes.
However, Ethereum staking is different because one can’t quickly unstake or withdraw ETH, even with the current
timelock. It takes time, liquidity is complex, and there is often a queue that could take several days to clear.
The new proposal wants to tackle that.
The proposed dynamic timelock assumes that, as enough users, who aren't satisfied with a proposed change, deposit their
stETH (or wrapped stETH and withdrawal of NFTs) into a designated escrow contract for withdrawal, the timelock duration
begins to increase — this is called crossing the “first seal” (set at 1% of total Lido ETH staked).
If discontent continues and deposits cross the “second seal” threshold (10% of Lido’s ETH TVL), a ""rage quit"" is
triggered: execution of the DAO’s decision is completely blocked until all protesting stakers have had the chance to
withdraw their ETH.
This creates a sort of safety valve — allowing stakers to signal objection and exit — while still giving the DAO time to
respond or cancel the contentious action.
The plan comes as Ethereum has surged more than 30% over the past week, riding momentum from its Pectra upgrade, which
introduced execution-layer reforms to improve scalability and efficiency.
The rally has sparked renewed attention on Ethereum-native applications like Lido, which is critical in capital flow and
validator participation across the chain — and directly impacts ETH market structure.
The LIP-28 proposal is still in its discussion phase, with a formal on-chain vote expected in the coming weeks.
If approved, the change could shift how governance is distributed across Ethereum’s staking ecosystem, setting a
precedent for other DeFi protocols seeking to include users, not just tokenholders, in decision-making. Lido's other
competitors include Rocket Pool and Frax Ether.
LDO prices have risen 6.5% in the past 24 hours, while the CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, climbed 2.5%.

187,"As Meta Said to Mull Tokens, Senator Warren Calls for Blocking Big Tech Stablecoins","Tech titan Meta (META) has reportedly been looking into the possibility of areturn to the stablecoin marketafter having
spurred a U.S. regulatory backlash from its efforts in years past, and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren told CoinDesk that
the pending legislation to govern stablecoins needs to insist that's not possible.

A high-stakes crypto bill to set up U.S. rules for stablecoins such as Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC was virtually
sailing through the Senate until Democrats — including some who had supported the effort in committee — rose against it
in recent days andhalted the bill's progresson the Senate floor this week. The Guiding and Establishing National
Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act needs to change to prevent the large corporations from issuing their own
money, Warren said.

""The Senate must fix the GENIUS Act so it prohibits Big Tech companies and other commercial giants from owning or
affiliating with stablecoin companies,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement to CoinDesk. ""No Senator should
vote to make it easier for Big Tech to pry into our financial transactions or choke off small businesses and political
adversaries from the payments system.""

Six years ago, Meta sought to launch its own crypto stablecoin, Libra (later called Diem), and nearly made it to the
finish line before an uproar from certain regulators and lawmakers derailed the project. She argued that Meta chief Mark
Zuckerberg, whose companygave $1 millionto President Donald Trump's inaugural fund, is trying to get back into the
business, and she called for Zuckerberg ""to explain to Congress if this is another attempt to control the American
people’s money.""

When asked for comment on Warren's views, Meta directed CoinDesk to what communication director Andy Stone hadposted on
social media site X: ""Diem is 'dead.' There is no Meta stablecoin.""

The GENIUS Act is now back in negotiations, and some lawmakers remained hopeful it could reappear on the Senate floor as
early as next week. There's also a House of Representatives version similarly winding its way through the process in
that chamber of Congress.

Warren, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee has been busy with her crypto-sector scrutiny, also joining
in with colleagues on Friday to question Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Attorney General Pam Bondi on their
interactions with Binance as it reportedly sought to smooth out the U.S. legal demands the exchange still labors under
after a 2023 settlement.
Five DemocratIc senators — also including Richard Blumenthal, Chris Van Hollen, Mazie Horono and Sheldon Whitehouse
—sent a letter to the officialsabout the exchange's discussions with the U.S. government as Binance increasesbusiness
tieswith World Liberty Financial, the crypto company tied to President Donald Trump and his family.
""As the administration loosens oversight on an industry where bad actors have violated money laundering and sanctions
law, it is not surprising that Binance, which has admitted to prioritizing its own growth and profits over compliance
with U.S. law, would seek to roll back the oversight required by its settlement,"" they wrote in the letter, noting
Binance's constraints based on its past guilty pleas to a list of charges including money laundering and sanctions
violations, for which the company is still under the observation of independent monitors.
""Our concerns about Binance’s compliance obligations are even more pressing given recent reports that the company is
using the Trump family’s stablecoin to partner with foreign investment companies,"" the senators said.
Spokespeople for Binance didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

206,"Dogecoin Surges 10%, Bitcoin Nears $104K Amid Renewed ‘Risk-on’ Sentiment","Bitcoin pushed past the six-figure mark for the first time in over two months, coming within a hair of $104,000 in early
Asian hours Saturday, as crypto markets staged a sharp rebound on improving macro sentiment and Ethereum’s latest
network upgrade.
DogecoinDOGE$0.23756led the gains among majors with a 10% rally, while etherETH$2,506.99rose 3.5% following the
successful implementation of its long-awaited Pectra upgrade, bringing weekly gains over 30%.
Other majors, including SolanaSOL$173.22, CardanoADA$0.81907, xrpXRP$2.42, and BNB Chain’sBNB$654.43, rose between 2%
and 6%, driven by a shift in investor sentiment from caution to risk-on.
The move follows a string of pro-crypto developments in the U.S. this week. On Wednesday, New Hampshire passed a bill
allowing the state to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Arizona followed suit a day later with its own legislation
supporting a crypto reserve. The state-level momentum comes as political leaders lean further into digital asset policy
ahead of the November election in some states.
President Donald Trump’s bullish remarks on upcoming U.S.-China trade talks also helped ease market jitters. The
comments coincided with the U.S. and U.K. signing a fresh trade agreement that will remove reciprocal tariffs and lower
duties on American goods, further lifting sentiment across equities and crypto alike.
“President Trump's optimistic outlook on this weekend's China trade talks is easing fears of an escalating trade war,
encouraging traders to shift capital back into asset classes like cryptocurrencies,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a
message to CoinDesk. “This could very well drive bitcoin back towards its all-time high and potentially surpass it.”
BTC trades about 5% below its January record high of over $108,700 as of European morning hours on Saturday.
Analysts say the recent moves mark a decisive break from the sluggish price action that plagued altcoins through much of
March and April.
“Traders believe the crypto industry may have finally found its second wind as a hedge against market uncertainty,” Nick
Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.
“Investors are changing their perspectives on crypto now that altcoins have departed from a negative trend and found
buying pressure from a renewed risk-on sentiment,” Ruck added.
Ethereum’s 30% rally this week is also being attributed to growing institutional interest and the momentum behind its
Pectra upgrade, which introduces long-anticipated execution layer reforms aimed at boosting efficiency and scalability.
“The upgrade provides reforms Ethereum desperately needs to cement its position as a leading chain amidst growing
competition,” BTSE’s Mei said. “Given that Ethereum is trading well below its all-time high, we could see substantial
upside in the coming weeks and months, especially as macro fears ease and institutions become more willing to allocate
towards crypto and crypto ETFs.”
Still, traders are closely watching this weekend’s U.S.-China trade negotiations. Talks are set to begin later on
Saturday in Switzerland, and any signs of stalemate or renewed tension could undercut the current rally.

213,Trump Family-Linked Firms Profited $320M on Memecoin Despite 87% Decline Since Day One,"CORRECTION (May 9, 11:58 UTC):Corrected headline, first bullet to say Trump-family linked firms profited millions from
TRUMP token. Added details in the 11th paragraph about the creators of the token and their ties to trading revenue.
U.S. President Donald Trump has come a long way since hesaidthe value of crypto was “based on thin air” in 2019. So much
so that he is now one of the sector’s largest proponents, foraying into memecoins, DeFi, NFTs, and even stablecoins.
A new report by the StateDemocracy Defenders Fundestimates that Trump’s family has increased their net worth by $2.9
billion thanks to crypto, and that now 40% of that net worth is being held in crypto assets.
His deepening ties to the industry have reverberated across the political landscape, to the point that a broadly
bipartisan stablecoinbill failed in a key vote Thursdayafter Democrats expressed concern about the extent to which he is
profiting off the sector.
Trump's support helped spark a continued bull market after his election victory in November, a market that's been
dominated by two trends: memecoins and institutional adoption of bitcoin via ETFs. While the latter is the province of,
generally, institutional investors and providers, it's the memecoin business that puts retail investors at risk and is
potentially ripe for exploitation.
On Thursday, Solidus Labs claimed that98% of memecoinsissued on the token creation platform pump.fun were rug pulls or
pump-and-dump schemes. The platform had since refuted the report's claims.
Another analysis by Chainalysis, cited byCNBC, suggested that the vast majority of TRUMP token holders lost money.
A memecoin is a type of crypto token with no inherent value, often based, as the name suggests, on a meme or cartoon
character. Popular examples of this are dogecoin (DOGE), shiba inu (SHIB) and pepe (PEPE). The craze reached a climax in
January when Trump touted his own TRUMP token on social media, followed by MELANIA— named after his wife.
TRUMP, which hit a day-one peak of $77.26, is now trading at $10.80, down a whopping 86%. MELANIA slumped even further,
losing more than 97% of its value in four months to trade recently at 33 cents.
The hype around Trump’s social media post led to a flurry of trading activity.Datafrom Chainalysis reveals that 760,000
wallets, mainly belonging to retail investors, lost money on the TRUMP token.
A small group of people, however, was immune to those losses. The Chainanalysis data show 58 wallets made profits in
excess of $10 million. The token’s creators netted a whopping $320 million in trading fees, although it’s worth noting
that around 5% of the fees went to the decentralized exchange Meteora, which hosted the launch.
CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of The Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC collectively own 80% of the TRUMP
token's supply, subject to a 3-year unlocking schedule, according to theofficial website. CIC Digital LLC and
Celebration Cards LLC, the owners of Fight Fight Fight LLC, will also receive revenue derived from trading activities of
the token, the website said.
MELANIA was allegedly scooped up by a group of insiders before it was advertised on social media in a technique known as
“sniping.” This group of insiders made $100 million on MELANIA tokens by swapping tokens for USDC after its price
doubled, according to aninvestigationby the Financial Times.
One insider with access to the tokens before they went live was Kelsier Ventures’ Hayden Davis, who revealed his
involvement during an interview in February. Davis was also the brains behind the botched LIBRA stablecoin thatbrought
political chaosto Argentina.
In an interview with Coffeezilla in February, Davis said: “This is going to put me in a lot of danger. Which is fine,
I’ll answer. I was a part of it [MELANIA]. I think the team did want to snipe it because of how big the snipe was on
TRUMP. We definitely weren’t the big sniper, that was what we were trying to avoid. We didn’t take any liquidity out,
zero.”
Trump’s foray into crypto isn't limited to memecoins.
The U.S. president’s family is also behind World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform thatraised
around $590 millionacross two pre-sale rounds earlier this year. It raised funds at a time when the market was resting
around all-time highs, so that figure of raised crypto is now much less.Arkham Intelligence datasuggests that World
Liberty Financial holds around $103 million worth of crypto.
Trump also attempted to ride the coattails of non-fungible token (NFT) hype in 2022, releasing a series of cartoons
depicting the president as a superhero or a cartoon character. Trump made around $8 million from rolling out these NFTs,
according tofinancial disclosures.
Most recently, there was the crypto dinner event, which saw Trump host a group of 25 TRUMP holders to a private dinner
and tour of his Virginia golf club. A Bloombergreportreveals that 19 of those 25 holders were either foreign entities or
used an offshore exchange banned in the U.S.
He's set to host another dinner for the top 220 holders of his token later in May. U.S. Senators Adam Schiff (D-Calif.)
and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.called forTrump’s impeachment, asking the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to investigate
whether Trump violated federal ethics rules by inviting top investors.
The Trump family did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.

226,"When it comes to backing winners, the UK is not snooker loopy enough"," Andy Haldane PublishedMay 10 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. The writer, an FT contributing editor, is chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts and former chief economist at the Bank of England The World Snooker Championship concluded this week at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, its home for the past 48 years. This year’s was the biggest ever, attracting nearly 200mn viewers globally to see the first Chinese world champion, Zhao Xintong. At the start of this century, the equivalent viewing figures were less than 5mn. Despite its success, next year could well be the last for the Crucible as host as its existing agreement with the World Snooker Tour comes to an end. The WST wants a larger, more state-of-the-sport venue, perhaps with Saudi Arabia or China as hosts and backers. The commercial case is clear. The global market for snooker is growing rapidly, led by a grassroots explosion in China and the Middle East, filling large sports stadiums and with rising prize money. Capacity at the Crucible, at under 1,000, is small and unchanged in half a century. Prize money for the world champion, at £500,000, is modest by modern sport standards. The magnetic attraction of money has already led several sports to move to where the pockets (financial, not snooker) are deepest. The centre of gravity in cricket has switched to India, with the Indian Premier League the largest global cricketing franchise. Saudi Arabia is now the global hub for boxing. A Saudi-backed alternative world golf tour began three years ago. This external migration is not confined to sport. ARM (semiconductors), DeepMind (AI) and Darktrace (cyber security) were all world-leading UK companies snapped up by international bidders and, given subsequent growth, prematurely. Sold in haste, the UK is now repenting at leisure as it seeks to nurture the superstar businesses essential to shape industrial strategy and kick-start growth. This is nuts. The UK can ill-afford to lose winners like these. UK sport, with its history and incumbency advantages, is a sector rich in success stories. Football, invented here in the 19th century, is now the world’s largest sport by popularity, participation and on some metrics revenues. Despite the country representing less than 1 per cent of the global population, the English Premier League is the leading football league by revenue anywhere. Modern tennis, another 19th-century English invention, ranks among the top 10 global sports, with decades-long revenue and popularity growth expected to continue. The premier tennis tournament in the world is Wimbledon, with revenue of £400mn last year. It was British Army officers that devised snooker during the same era. Smaller than football or tennis, the growth rates in revenues and participation are equally strong as it penetrates large expanding markets in China, the Middle East and prospectively India, where it was first played. Letting snooker slip from Sheffield’s grip at this point would be as myopic an act as selling an ARM, a leg or a Deepmind. The government will only achieve national growth by growing the UK’s regions and nations. In pursuit of that, leaders in municipal areas and mayoralties have been handed more powers but not more money. Oddly, Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ growth speech in January offered precious little either to the regions or to sport. (The announcement of anew football stadium for Manchester Uniteddoesn’t count — the supporters mostly live in London.) Yet, backed at scale, sport is one of the most effective drivers of local growth. There is no better example than Stratford in east London, home of the 2012 London Olympics. Its transformation from dereliction to gentrification came courtesy of £9.3bn in public money and, from the start, a focus on legacy. The All England Club which hosts Wimbledon has invested over half a billion pounds upgrading and extending its estate and government support for grassroots tennis runs to tens of millions. The comparison with Sheffield and snooker is salutary. A fan of both, I am fully invested. Government, alas, is not. Investment per capita in the city of Sheffield is less than half Manchester’s and one-tenth the London borough of Westminster’s. Investment in Sheffield’s Crucible Theatre has been small change. As a sport, snooker has never received a penny of public money. If we are serious about growth outside the South East, the playing field needs levelling. The chancellor’s Spending Review in June is an opportunity to do so. Investing in snooker in Sheffield would anchor it as the global hub, crowding-in the private finance that generates wider growth benefits as enjoyed by Stratford and Wimbledon. And an investment in snooker’s grassroots would create the talent pipeline necessary for sustaining success. China has 300,000 snooker clubs, the UK just a few hundred. Yet the Chinese world champion, Zhao Xintong, trains in Sheffield. Wimbledon and Sheffield “fortnights” could become the north and south poles of sport in England. Catching, rather than selling, a rising sports star could drive growth and pride locally while boosting the UK’s standing globally. In this century, Sheffield and snooker could become as synonymous, and internationally recognised, as were Sheffield and steel in the previous one.

227,Pakistan launches military retaliation against India," Humza Jilaniin Islamabad andJohn Reedin New Delhi andKrishn Kaushikin Mumbai PublishedMay 10 2025 UpdatedMay 10 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Pakistan and India lurched closer to full-scale war early on Saturday after Islamabad said it had launched short-range missiles over the border and India targeted air bases deep inside its neighbour’s territory. India said Pakistan was moving troops towards the border. New Delhi said the move would escalate the conflict by potentially adding ground operations to cross-border aerial strikes. Pakistan’s military declined to comment on the claim. Later on Saturday, US President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social network that the two countries had “agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire”. It was not immediately clear whether that was the case. “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,” he said. Earlier in the day, Pakistan said that it had launched Operation Bunyān Mārsūs — named after a Koranic phrase that the military said meant “Iron Wall” — as a response to missile and drone attacks by India since Wednesday. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Military officials said the attacks targeted a storage site for India’s supersonic BrahMos missile in Beas in the state of Punjab, the Udhampur Air Field in the subregion of Jammu and Kashmir and an airfield in Pathankot, also in Punjab. Islamabad added that India had struck military bases overnight. The latest clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours was triggered by the mass shooting of 25 Indians and a Nepali citizen in Pahalgam, a tourist hub in Indian-administered Kashmir, on April 22. India blamed the attack on militants backed by Pakistan. Pakistan denied involvement. India responded on Wednesday by carrying out air strikes on what it said were terrorist camps in the Pakistan-administered part of Kashmir, which both countries claim. Pakistan soldiers raise their fists as they launch missiles against Indian military installations Analysts said Saturday’s strikes represented a significant intensification of the conflict. “This is escalatory from both sides and for two reasons,” said Sushant Singh, a lecturer in South Asian Studies at Yale University. “One is the choice of high-profile military targets like air bases, and the fact that both countries claim to have taken out air defence units on the other side, which is a signal that they are going to come with a bigger package in the next strike.” Pakistan’s foreign minister, however, said on Saturday that he was “quite hopeful” that Islamabad and New Delhi would soon find “a path to dialogue”. Ishaq Dar told local TV channel Geo: “If there is an iota of sanity, India after this will stop. And if they stop, we will also stop.” Before its strikes into India, Islamabad said its rival had launched six ballistic missiles towards three Pakistani air bases. These included the Nur Khan air base near the garrison city of Rawalpindi, which houses the military’s general headquarters. It said only a few missiles evaded air defences and none hit “air assets”. At a briefing on Saturday, India said Pakistan had attempted “air intrusions” at more than 26 places, from Srinagar in Kashmir in the north to Naliya, in Gujarat, near the southern tip of the border. India also said Pakistan had fired a high-speed missile at an air base in Punjab in the early hours and targeted health centres and schools in air force centres in Jammu and Kashmir. It said it responded with “precision attacks only on identified military targets”, including technical infrastructure, command and control centres, radar sites and weapons storage areas. An Indian district official in the border town of Rajouri in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir was killed in shelling from Pakistan, the region’s chief minister Omar Abdullah said. The cross-border exchanges represent their worst fighting since the Kargil War of 1999. India has styled the conflict as an essential blow against a regime it accuses of supporting terrorism. Pakistan maintains that it is defending itself against an attack over a crime it did not commit. Pakistan accuses India of killing 33 civilians, including seven children, since aerial and drone attacks began on Wednesday, and officials have vowed to “avenge” the lost lives. Inter-Services Public Relations, which speaks on behalf of Pakistan’s military, said it launched locally made Fattah missiles. A poster attached to a land-based launcher said the missiles were “with love from” the seven children Islamabad said were killed by India on Wednesday, according to images shared by ISPR. India has described its strikes on Pakistan as “measured, non-escalatory, proportionate, and responsible”. India fires on Pakistani military installations Diplomatic efforts to defuse the conflict intensified this week. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, phoned the Pakistani army chief Asim Munir to urge calm and offer help in starting talks between the neighbours “to avoid future conflicts”, according to the US state department. Saudi Arabia sent Adel al-Jubeir, a senior diplomat, to India and Pakistan this week. It said it was “part of the kingdom’s efforts to de-escalate and end the ongoing military confrontation”, Additional reporting by Ahmed Al Omran Comments have not been enabled for this article.",,https://www.ft.com/content/ebad770b-b290-4c4f-88e3-a1effdd0c50e,2025-05-11
228,Quantum Systems and Tekever each valued at more than €1bn in latest fundraisings," Tim BradshawandSylvia Pfeiferin London andPatricia Nilssonin Frankfurt PublishedMay 6 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. European investors are putting hundreds of millions of euros into two surveillance drone companies, Quantum Systems and Tekever, in deals that value each of the defence technology start-ups at more than €1bn. New investors areflockingto the market for defence or “dual use” technology, which can be used in both civilian applications and on the battlefield. The latest rounds come as the makers ofdronesdeployed in Ukraine’s war with Russia scale up production as Europe races to boost its defence capabilities, following the Trump administration’s threats to withdraw US military support in the region. Munich-based Quantum Systems has raised €160mn led by Balderton Capital, in the London-based venture firm’s first defence tech investment, alongside strategic backers Hensoldt and Airbus Defence and Space. The deal, which also includes existing investors including US venture capitalist and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, values Quantum at more than €1bn, according to people familiar with the terms. “The goal is to make the battlefield transparent and have real-time aerial intelligence from every part of the front line,” said Florian Seibel, co-chief executive and co-founder of Quantum Systems. “You can only shoot if you know where to shoot. So you need eyes in the sky.” Separately Tekever, which was founded in Portugal in 2001, said it raised tens of millions of euros from its existing investors, led by long-term existing backer Ventura Capital. Its new valuation was “beyond £1bn”, Ricardo Mendes, chief executive of Tekever, told the Financial Times, but he refused to specify the exact amount raised. Tekever last year raised €70mn in a round led by Baillie Gifford that was also backed by theNato Innovation Fund. Investment in European start-ups working on defence and related technologies jumped 24 per cent in 2024 to $5.2bn, according to figures from the Nato Innovation Fund and research group Dealroom. Quantum’s technology brings together drone hardware, software and artificial intelligence to build autonomous systems for real-time “aerial intelligence”. Its products have been used by countries including Germany, Ukraine and the US. Recommended After struggling to commercialise its drones in its initial target market of agriculture, Seibel, a former helicopter pilot in the German armed forces, decided to use commercial technology to take on traditional defence companies. “They are slow, they are expensive, they are arrogant,” he said. Its new product was ready just as Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022. Quantum generated €110mn in revenue last year and is on track to hit more than €200mn this year, Seibel said. It has production capacity in multiple countries to produce up to 4,000 drones a year in various configurations. Rana Yared, general partner at Balderton Capital, said Quantum could “scale quickly” to become one of the leading lights of Europe’s defence tech industries. Balderton wanted to invest in Quantum, which has more than doubled its annual revenue for the past several years, because of its diversity of customers and applications, which also include mining, infrastructure and emergency services. “Our goal is to invest in companies that have great trajectories in a world that is highly peaceful,” Yared said. “It would be cavalier to invest in a company that only does well in this negative geopolitical [situation].” Recommended Nonetheless, the battlefields of Ukraine have driven rapid growth for many defence tech start-ups, including Munich-basedHelsing, which has raised hundreds of millions of euros. Mendes said the war in Ukraine had made every government “in Europe aware that the nature of the technology being used in the field has changed”. Demand had been such that Tekever had been “more than doubling” its production capacity every year. It expects to produce more than 200 systems this year. One of the biggest challenges, he said, was how quickly the industry can scale up. Tekever, which also has operations in the UK, makes AI-enabled drones for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. Two of its drones, the AR3 and the AR5, have been used extensively in Ukraine, enabling precision strikes using real-time intelligence. Other customers include the European Maritime Safety Agency and the UK Home Office. Mendes said its new funds would help Tekever, which is already profitable, to deliver on a pledge to invest £400mn in the UK over the next five years.",,https://www.ft.com/content/ef976315-40bb-4063-bdbe-f133d1a19b2e,2025-05-11
229,What the turmoil in Asian currencies tells us," Katie Martin PublishedMay 10 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Asian markets this week gave alively tasterof what a full-blown currency war might look like under Trump 2.0. But we are not at panic stations yet, and probably (touch wood) will not be any time soon. It has, to be sure, been a week of high drama in a typically sleepy corner of markets. Seemingly out of nowhere, the Taiwanese dollar shot to the moon, jumping by, at the extremes, 10 per cent in two days. Even after calming down a little since, it is up by 6 per cent this month. That was not all, however. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also intervened at the heaviest pace since 2020 to stop its currency from rising too far against its US cousin. Brace yourself, because any day now, the have-a-go heroes betting on a break in Hong Kong’s 42-year-old peg against the UScurrencywill resurface. It is one of the most reliable widow-maker trades out there and so help them, the people who have tried and failed at it before will try and fail at it again. It’s always fun while it lasts though. Of the two, it is the Taiwanese dollar that has caught the most market attention, and it is easy to extrapolate and catastrophise from here. One reason for that is the enormous amount of dollar exposure sitting with life insurers in Taiwan — around $700bn accumulated over the past decade, a third or so with no currency hedging. Those holders are now sitting on large paper losses. The speed of the ascent in the Taiwanese currency is a legitimate cause for concern. Straight lines going up or down in markets charts, in pretty much any asset class, are a bad thing. It can take time for bodies to rise to the surface, but someone somewhere will always take a horrible hit and accidents can happen. In addition, this can easily become self-fulfilling. Asian investors might, quite reasonably, feel unsettled by this currency blow and either sell dollar holdings outright, or hedge against further currency risk — an act that in itself helps to push the dollar further lower. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. Stephen Jen at Eurizon SLJ Asset Management is among those warning of the theoretical risk that this could get ugly. In a note this week, he and his colleague Joana Freire said they reckoned Asian exporting nations had accumulated perhaps as much as $2.5tn in dollar hoardings since the pandemic five years ago. This creates what he calls “avalanche risk” for the dollar. “Changes in the underlying macroeconomic conditions, such as yield differentials, relative fiscal positions, valuation, and geopolitical factors, could potentially trigger a non-linear sell-off in the dollar,” he said. “We continue to believe the risks of investors being blindsided by such a non-linear sell-off continue to rise.” It is a tail risk, but one worth taking seriously. The other important thing here is the context. Donald Trump is clearly keen to seal deals on trade around the world, as this week’s agreement with the UK shows. Viewed through that lens, and especially with the desire in some parts of the administration for a weaker US dollar, the jump in the Taiwanese currency might well help to assuage some US concerns. There have been signs that US administration might be distancing itself from the notion that Trump might seek to forge a grand international agreement to weaken the dollar globally and bolt defence and security guarantees on to US government bonds. The idea now seems dead on arrival given the risks to Treasuries and the focus on tariffs. But the market is still sensitive about where currencies might fit in to trade deals. “There’s no direct evidence” that potential tariff talks was a factor here, said Shahab Jalinoos, a currencies analyst at UBS in New York. “But if the market believes something like that is a possibility, that could be disruptive” as investors and speculators of all stripes would try to get ahead of any agreement and shove markets around. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. It is much more likely, Jalinoos said, that any Asian trade deals with the US will settle on vague assurances that countries are broadly supportive of, such as higher interest rates and somewhat stronger currencies, without pinpointing levels or timelines. That’s more manageable. It suggests slow and steady market adjustments. But canny communication — not exactly the US’s current strong suit — will be key to helping that happen. So, “avalanches” and currency wars are the tail risks here. Unlikely, but worth bearing in mind, and potentially highly disruptive. If 2025 has taught us nothing else so far, it is to be ready for shocks. The “everybody calm down” argument, though, is also pretty strong. Even after this week’s eye-popping ascent, the Taiwanese dollar is up by 8 per cent against the buck so far this year. So is the euro. Sure, Taiwan’s move happened in the blink of an eye, and that’s possibly not helpful, but this is just a catch-up. The US dollar’s broader descent is also, some scary moments aside, very orderly so far. Second, the really big risks to the dollar remain the same: US geopolitical errors that lead to a sudden loss of confidence in the buck as the main global reserve currency, and US policy errors that create a recession and drag US interest rates down fast. It is unlikely that Asia will cause a mess here. The US can still do that all by itself. katie.martin@ft.com",,https://www.ft.com/content/68990297-217a-460c-88dd-6b762c3530a1,2025-05-11
230,Skirmish is first test of Beijing’s military hardware against advanced western technology," Mehul SrivastavaandCharles Cloverin London, andHumza Jilaniin Islamabad PublishedMay 9 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Even before the fog of war had begun to lift, the Chengdu Aircraft Company’s stock had started to soar. Almost three decades after first taking to the skies, the Chinese plane-maker’s first fighter jet, the J-10 Vigorous Dragon, had finally seen combat — and survived. By 4amon May 7, Chinese diplomats in Islamabad were at the foreign ministry, poring over results from the first face-off between modern Chinese warplanes, replete with missiles and radars untested in battle, and advanced western hardware deployed byIndia. As evidence mounted, while remaining inconclusive, that a Pakistani pilot in the latest variant of the Vigorous Dragon may have shot down India’s French-made Rafale jet, Chengdu’s share price leapt more than 40 per cent in just two days. “There’s no better advertisement than a real combat situation,” said Yun Sun, a specialist in Chinese military affairs at the Stimson Center in Washington DC. “This came as a pleasant surprise for China . . . the result is quite striking.” While India andPakistanmay be embroiled in their deepest skirmish in decades, the conflict is also a testing ground for equipment crucial to a different rivalry — that between China and the US-led western alliance. About 81 per cent of Pakistan’s military equipment comes from China, including more than half its 400-strong fighter and ground attack aircraft, according to estimates by the Stockholm Peace Research Institute and the International Institute for Strategic Studies. That reflects an “all weather friendship” that China has cultivated since the 1960s with Pakistan to try and ringfence India. The materiel it provides Pakistan has evolved alongside China’s own defence industry, said Andrew Small, an expert on Pakistan-China relations at the German Marshall Foundation. “Aside from the co-operation on nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, a lot of what China supplied used to be low-end stuff — tanks, artillery, small arms,” said Small. Now, however, Pakistan “is becoming a showcase for some of China’s newer capabilities”. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. India, meanwhile, has emerged as the world’s largest weapons importer as its wealth and regional ambitions have grown. Over the past decade, it has shifted from a reliance on Russian suppliers to the US, France and Israel for almost half of its own recent purchases, including sophisticated fighter jets, transport aircraft and combat and surveillance drones. “This is the most important global aspect here — this is the first time Chinese military equipment has been tested against top notch western equipment,” said Sushant Singh, lecturer at South Asian Studies at Yale University. “Whenever and however this ends, the balance sheet will tell us what will happen in Taiwan, and which direction should western defence companies go to counter the low cost and high tech capabilities that the Chinese have shown.” When countries go to war, their allies watch and learn. After Ukraine repelled a nearly 50-mile column of Russian armour — tanks, armoured vehicles and others — using modern, shoulder-fired British and American missiles, Indian diplomats in Kyiv were monitoring it closely. “Is it true what they say about Russian tanks — clumsy, easily lolly-popped,” one asked an FT journalist returning from the frontline, referring to how missiles would blow the tops off tanks. When Taiwan saw how effective the US-made Himars medium-range precision missile system was at hitting Russian targets behind the frontline, it lobbied to move up the delivery of its own orders. By next year, it will own almost 30 of the truck-mounted systems — which is more than Ukraine. Even short skirmishes, such as those India and Pakistan have regularly fought, serve a unique purpose. Enemies test each other, and show off their own capabilities, seeking to enforce existing red lines and set new ones. They generate vast amounts of operational data that shapes the next skirmish — or wins the next war. Allies share that data and arms manufacturers analyse it, tweaking their own weapons systems. Defence attachés from China’s western rivals were waiting “impatiently”, said one in New Delhi, for India to share the radar and electronic signatures of the J-10C while in combat mode so that their own aerial defences could be trained on it. Similarly for China, this skirmish was a test not just of the aircraft but the sophisticated radar system — called an active electronically scanned array — mounted in the front of the plane. The combat tested its ability to not just hunt out threats but help guide the missiles. Aurangzeb Ahmed, Pakistan’s deputy chief of air operations, said PL-15 variants were among the missiles used in the skirmish this week. The hour-long engagement would be “studied in the classroom”, bragged Ahmed. “We knocked some sense into these guys.” Robert Tollast, a researcher at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said the use of PL-15E missile could be “highly significant”. Indian media reported that an intact PL-15 had been recovered, providing a chance to study its secrets. “If confirmed, we have now seen the demonstration of a Chinese-made AESA on a beyond-visual-range-missile, used in combat,” he said. Western nations and Russia have been battle testing their versions of AESA’s for decades. Details of just this single skirmish — such as how many missiles were fired to successfully hit a target — “could be tremendously useful for the Chinese in evaluating the capability of this weapon”, Tollast said. Neither the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, nor Chengdu Aircraft responded to a request for comment. On the other side of the ledger, the success of Indian missiles — many of them reportedly long-range French SCALP missiles — in finding their targets showed both the weakness and paucity of Pakistani aerial defences. Pakistan is known to deploy China’s HQ-9 systems, which are a generation behind the sophistication of Russian S-400s and are at the top-end of India’s inventory. “The fact is that even at a time of extreme high alert, Indian missiles penetrated Pakistani airspace without being detected,” said Laxman Kumar Behera, who specialises on India’s national security at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. India’s retaliation on Thursday targeted Pakistan’s “air defence radars and systems at a number of locations in Pakistan”, according to the Indian military. “That’s a very precise display of a very high-end capability — taking out the defences, rather than an actual target,” said a senior western diplomat based in Delhi. “It’s a carefully calibrated warning — it says, look, if we can come take the lock off your door, then we can come into the house whenever we want.” Both India and Pakistan have gleaned crucial details about their rival’s strengths from past clashes — and identified weaknesses of their own. After India successfully wrested back territory in the Himalayas from a Pakistani encroachment in 1999, an internal inquiry showed its ageing Russian fleet of MiG’s struggled to manoeuvre in the mountain passes, or find targets in the snow while evading shoulder mounted missiles. Three aircraft were shot down in three days before India switched to French Mirages — the first deployment of precision and laser guided missiles by the Indian Air Force, and the beginning of a shift away from Russian to western aircraft. Similarly, after India responded to the 2019 killing of 40 security personnel by a Pakistan-based militant group with air strikes in the Balakot region of Pakistan, it not only lost a MiG 21 aircraft but its forces mistakenly shot down a helicopter in a friendly fire incident, killing seven. “The officers of the Pakistani army have looked after me very well — they are thorough gentlemen,” the captured pilot was shown saying in a propaganda video before his release. “And the tea is fantastic.” The two incidents underscored that India lacked sufficient airborne early warning and control systems — planes that fly at high altitudes carrying sophisticated radars and sensors that can detect enemy aircraft, missiles and drones at range. But India’s bureaucratic challenges made learning from each skirmish difficult, and inefficient, as compared to a simpler procurement system for Pakistan, which has one main supplier — China — and a military that dominates the country. Only in March this year did India issue an “acceptance of necessity” notice to triple India’s fleet of such early warning aircraft to 18. Their deployment is years away. “If these tit-for-tat aerial retaliations continue for much longer, India will feel their absence sorely,” said a second western defence attaché based in New Delhi. “If it turns out that India lost a French jet to a Chinese missile fired from over 100km away, then that need is clearly urgent.” Comments have not been enabled for this article.",,https://www.ft.com/content/ff46ca13-a64d-4ba1-833e-1bb348880aec,2025-05-11
231,Elton John and Dua Lipa urge Starmer to back UK artists in AI copyright row," Daniel Thomas PublishedMay 9 2025 UpdatedMay 10 2025 Simply sign up to theMediamyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Sir Paul McCartney, Richard Curtis and Dua Lipa are among the 400 top musicians, artists and media executives who have written to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer seeking support to protect copyright from being ripped off by artificial intelligence tools. The letter calls on Starmer to back an amendment next week to a bill introduced by Baroness Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer, that would give transparency and protection over whether artists’ work is being used to train AI models. Kidron’s amendment would maketech giantstell copyright owners which individual works — from music and books to films and newspapers — they have used to train theirAI models. This would allow companies and artists “to hold AI firms accountable for the mass theft of creative works that continues to take place”, the letter says. The letter also has support from Coldplay, Sir Elton John, Russell T Davies, Antony Gormley and senior executives from news groups such as the Telegraph and The Times. The Financial Times has also signed the letter. The amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill was this week defeated in the House of Commons, but will be voted on again in the House of Lords on Monday. The government has made its own amendments that would guarantee an economic impact assessment of different options, while ministers are retreating from a previously “preferred” position that would have meant that creative industries would need to opt out from their work being scraped by AI. Officials insist all options are on the table following the end of a consultation into various proposals this year. A government spokesperson said: “We want our creative industries and AI companies to flourish, which is why we’re consulting on a package of measures that we hope will work for both sectors. We’re clear that no changes will be considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators.” However, executives are still concerned that tech groups will ultimately be allowed to override copyright rules unless the government provides legislative backing guaranteeing transparency and protection. The letter warns that if artists are forced to give away their work, the UK “will lose an immense growth opportunity . . . and with it our future income, the UK’s position as a creative powerhouse, and any hope that the technology of daily life will embody the values and laws of the UK”. The use of the data bill is the latest attempt by the creative industries to protect their copyright from being used by AI groups without attribution or payment. Kidron said the UK creative industries “must not be sacrificed to the interests of a handful of US tech companies”. She added: “The UK is in a unique position to take its place a global player in the international AI supply chain, but to grasp that opportunity requires the transparency provided for in my amendments, which are essential to create a vibrant licensing market.” Lord Kevin Brennan of Canton, former MP and Labour Peer, said: “We cannot let mass copyright theft inflict damage on our economy for years to come.”",,https://www.ft.com/content/5a6601f7-a9c9-4f3b-a205-b4f8fe3e688d,2025-05-11
232,Taiwanese outsourcer will develop and supply an electric vehicle to launch in Australia and New Zealand," Paddy Stephensin Taipei PublishedMay 7 2025 Simply sign up to theElectric vehiclesmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Foxconn has made a landmark entry into the car industry after the Taiwanese iPhone supplier struck a deal to manufacture electric vehicles for Mitsubishi Motors of Japan. According to a memorandum of understanding between the companies, Foxtron, anEVsubsidiary of the world’s biggest contract electronics manufacturer, will develop and produce a Mitsubishi vehicle aimed at the Australian and New Zealand markets. The deal is a coup for Foxconn, which has been working tobreak into EV productionsince 2019, and marks a turning point for an automotive industry in which in-house manufacturing prowess has historically been essential to competitive advantage. Foxtron said that it aimed to speed up EV development by using standardised platforms and components. It said that it looked forward “to a collaboration that will complement both parties and drive both business expansions”. Mitsubishi Motors has focused its efforts on plug-in hybrids, which can be recharged like electric vehicles, but have an internal combustion engine as backup. Like other established car companies, it is struggling to fight back against the growing dominance of Chinese EVs. Foxconn makes gadgets such as the iPhone for Apple and the PlayStation for Sony. Its EV business forms part of a long-term push to grow and to diversify away from iPhone assembly, which has faced disruption in recent months because of US tariff announcements. On Monday, the group reported a 26 per cent year-on-year rise in revenue for the month of April as “strong pull-in momentum for AI” boosted its cloud and networking products and businesses rushed to place orders ahead of tariffs. The new EV model announced on Wednesday is expected to enter the Australasian markets in the second half of 2026. It will be manufactured in Taiwan. Mitsubishi’s strengths include its line-up of hybrids, presence in south-east Asia and popular off-road vehicles. However, the company has struggled to keep up with the shift to EVs given its smaller scale. Foxconn had previously made overtures to Renault aboutbuying a stake in Nissan, a larger Japanese carmaker, as a way into the automotive market. That idea did not move forward. Nissan is Mitsubishi’s second-largest shareholder, however, so the deal offers Foxconn another route to develop a connection. As well as exploring a collaboration with Foxconn, Mitsubishi said it planned to work with its alliance partners, Nissan and Renault, to strengthen its line-up of electrified vehicles.",,https://www.ft.com/content/6fc883fd-a3a3-4272-8a73-facf473cae0f,2025-05-11
233,Jesse Levinson of Amazon Zoox: ‘The public has less patience for robotaxi mistakes’," Rafe Uddinin San Francisco PublishedMay 7 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Jesse Levinson, co-founder and chief technology officer of Amazon-owned robotaxi start-up Zoox, and his team are betting that the vehicles’ pod-shaped design will be the preferred shape of future autonomous transportation. The company is testing its technology on roads across six US cities with plans to launch commercially this year in Las Vegas, followed by San Francisco. The vehicles have no steering wheel and four inward facing seats. Based in San Francisco’s Bay Area, Levinson has been working on self-driving vehicles for about two decades. He developed algorithms for the runner-up entry in the 2007 Darpa Urban Challenge, the driverless car contest sponsored by the US Department of Defense that helped spawn Google’s self-driving unit Waymo, before founding Zoox in 2014. Zoox was acquired by Amazon in 2020 for $1.3bn and has since grown from 1000 to more than 2,500 employees. The Financial Times’ San Francisco reporter Rafe Uddin and Levinson rode in a Zoox robotaxi as it toured the Design District of San Francisco. They discussed the company’s manufacturing plans and public safety. — Jesse Levinson:Do you want to do the honours, or would you like us to? Rafe Uddin:Press this start button here? JL:All right. And off we go. RU:It’s nice and smooth so far. Also quite different to all the other vehicles that we’re used to, including the Waymos. Talk me through the design and why you came to a decision that this was the form you were going to adopt. JL:This is a much more natural social configuration where you can actually have a conversation with people. So, there are four of us here, and we’re all able to talk to and see each other. And that’s nice, right? Cars changed the configuration, with everybody facing the same way. It’s all designed around a driver with a steering wheel and pedals. That’s a suboptimal configuration for anything other than a human having to drive. RU:This is quite a low ride. In terms of rider comfort, what are you doing to improve things, particularly because vehicles encounter bad road conditions in cities including potholes? JL:One of the cool things we’ve been able to do with a ground-up vehicle is build it in what’s called an active suspension. Every wheel is able to go up and down independently so we can smooth out not 100 per cent of the bumps in the road but most of them. RU:You’re testing in San Francisco. I took a Waymo here to meet you. They’ve rolled out. They’re deploying. What lessons are you drawing from their customers’ experience? JL:We’ve been encouraged by Waymo’s progress and the adoption and reaction to the robotaxi concept. It wasn’t that long ago that people were sceptical that we’d see this technology within a decade, or some people even said within our lifetime. What’s cool to see with Waymo is that, not only does it work well, but people like it and, if anything, are probably willing to pay a little bit more to be in a robotaxi. Our value proposition is that we have this unique customer experience, which we think is better than any other vehicle on the road, whether or not it has a driver. A little bit of an interesting traffic situation here. That was tricky, but it handled it well. RU:We had a car jutting out that was double parked. A couple of pedestrians around. People coming at us from all sides on a multi-lane road. It seemed to handle that well and it was not uncomfortable. JL:You felt the [sudden] stop but that was for a good reason. When you’re in San Francisco, you sometimes do have to react to sudden things. We try to do it as smoothly as possible. RU:In terms of testing, it’s mostly employees and staff. What is the public feedback like? JL:For the last year we have been inviting our friends and family. We’re in the process of rolling out our Zoox Explorer [programme], what we call our unpaid riders, in Las Vegas. The reactions have been extremely positive. We always take it with a little bit of a grain of salt until we get truly random public reactions. RU:The plan is to launch in Las Vegas this year. Any firm timeline on when that’s going to happen now? Any date? JL:We have said we’ll be open to the public this year, and we’re still on track for that. It’s fair to say the second half of this year at this point. San Francisco will come a bit after Las Vegas. The FT’s technology reporters discuss the future of the digital world with the industry’s leaders, innovators and academics. The dialogues examine progress made as well as potential solutions to global problems.Read them all here RU:Talk me through the decision to go down the bespoke route. Waymo is a system added on top of conventional cars. Why opt to do this instead of just developing the core technology? JL:Our perspective from the beginning has been that the customer experience we can offer in a ground-up vehicle is well beyond anything you can offer in a retrofitted car. We talked about that earlier. This configuration, you just can’t do that in a car. Cars were not designed this way. They weren’t designed to be bidirectional. You’ll notice, from the exterior, this vehicle is quite short. One of my favourite surprising stats is it’s about a metre shorter than a Toyota Corolla, which is a small car. That’s great for dense urban areas. But on the inside, there’s so much more room than inside even a large car. We’ve been able to add a lot more safety and redundancy into this vehicle. People talk about safety but reliability is important, too. We don’t want our vehicles getting stuck on the side of the road because they couldn’t finish a mission because there was a hardware component failure. We have two motors and two batteries and two braking systems, two steering racks, four sensor pods. Our value proposition is our unique customer experience, which we think is better than any other vehicle on the road Lastly, the economics are much better. Of course, it costs more to develop and build this vehicle, but then it pays off. So, for example, we put a 132-kilowatt hour battery in this robotaxi. That’s much bigger than any of the batteries you’ll find in other retrofitted robotaxis. That means we can drive all day and all night long on a single charge. RU:Is there a mileage figure? JL:We are basically targeting a full day’s worth of operation, so daytime and night-time, with the vehicles coming home in the middle of the night to charge. Obviously, in the middle of the night there’s also significantly lower demand for these vehicles, so it’s not like we need the whole fleet out and about at four in the morning. RU:How will the fleet size, therefore, compare with other operators? JL:Our goal is to have a competitive fleet size. In San Francisco, there are around 8,000 Uber and Lyft drivers at any one time. So, that gives you a sense for the type of scale we’d like to operate at eventually. But, of course, it will take us some time to get to that level. But really, we think that when you have on the order of 1,000 to 2,000 robotaxis in a city like San Francisco, then you’re offering a competitive, fantastic service with no downsides, relative to existing services. RU:Can we talk about the cost of building a bespoke car? The decision to invest and spend the money to design, build and manufacture screams that it’s going to be higher than the cost of adding a kit to a car? JL:Yes and no. There are two kinds of costs. There’s the cost to develop this, which, of course, is significant. Then there’s the cost to build them. Our robotaxi costs more than a regular car, but so do retrofitted robotaxis. What we look at more than the cost of the vehicle is the cost of putting the vehicle in service. We don’t sell robotaxis. We sell rides. When you do that maths, it turns out that, even though the vehicle costs more than a car, it’s a relatively small fraction of the overall cost of running a service like this, because there’s electricity, insurance and credit card processing, tele-operations and data, maintenance. All these other charges add up. We’re at the point where the cost of the robotaxi is less than half of all of that. Plus, there’s a great road map for those costs to come down every year as their volumes increase and technology matures. So it’s not an area that we’re particularly concerned about. RU:How much have costs changed in the past few years? JL:It’s come down quite a lot, but these are still manufactured off prototype tooling. We have a couple dozen of these driving around public roads right now. We’ll have a lot more by the end of the year. And then next year is when we start what we call serial production, which is where you have the production tooling, and you start getting in hundreds and then thousands, and eventually tens of thousands of them. Those vehicles will cost significantly less than these because of the scale. RU:Talk a little bit more about serial production and the plans there. Will that be using the same facilities that you currently have, or are you planning a new manufacturing site? JL:We’ve been working on that. We haven’t yet announced exactly where we’ll be manufacturing. It is in the Bay Area, but we’ll be sharing more on that soon. RU:The plan is to manufacture in the US? JL:Yes, that’s right. RU:Seems like an opportune moment with tariffs. JL:We didn’t necessarily foresee the current climate with that, but we’re happy to be a California company actually manufacturing vehicles in California. There isn’t a lot of that right now, so we’re proud of that. RU:Are you seeing any effects from tariffs when it comes to components, sensors? And is that carrying through into the cost of manufacturing as well? JL:We’re tracking this on a daily basis, because there’s always a new development. We’re seeing small fluctuations in the bill of materials. But because the supply chain is quite global, and a lot of it is coming out of the US and the manufacturing is here, we’re probably more insulated from the swings than most companies are. Amazon is making a long-term bet on something that hopefully will be worth at least hundreds of billions of dollars some day RU:A couple of your competitors have made a bit of a bet in terms of importing a number of cars from China. Waymo is importingGeely’s Zeekrs. What does that mean in terms of Zoox’s competitiveness, particularly on cost? JL:We’re proud to be manufacturing our vehicles in California. That does seem to be extra advantageous at the moment. I can’t comment on anybody else’s unit economics or business plans. But I will say that, again, we’re comfortable with our strategy, and probably more so now than ever. RU:What components are you able to source from the US at the moment? JL:We’re probably not sharing the specifics of which parts come from where, partly for competitive reasons. But a lot of them come from the US. A lot of the subcomponents are assembled in the US. One thing to note, our manufacturing strategy is a bit different from traditional automotive, in that we don’t have, for example, a paint shop and a body shop. So, we source larger components from our supply chain. And we call what we do at the end a final assembly process. RU:Is the plan to try and do a bit more of what a car manufacturer might do in terms of manufacturing, particularly, you mentioned earlier trying to increase to something like 1,000 to 2,000 robotaxis in San Francisco? JL:We have the capability to manufacture tens of thousands of robotaxis with our existing facilities. And again, while that’s fairly low volume from an automotive perspective when you sell cars, from a robotaxi perspective, that’s a pretty meaningful amount of volume. RU:You founded Zoox in 2014. We’re now 11 years down the line but the company’s vehicles haven’t hit the roads with the public. How important was the Amazon acquisition in 2020? JL:Existentially important. We had raised $1bn prior to the acquisition. That’s a lot of money by any normal standards. It just turns out not to be a lot of money in this particular space. We no longer had the ability to raise the type of capital you need to compete in this market as a private company. RU:Why Amazon and not, say, a car manufacturer or somebody else? JL:Amazon is one of the most successful and valuable companies in the world. For them, they’re making a long-term bet on something that hopefully will be worth at least hundreds of billions of dollars some day, if everything goes well. If you look at most of the major car companies. It’s hard for them to make this type of investment, where the timelines are a bit uncertain and the payouts aren’t guaranteed. And so, you need probably an even larger company with more ability to deploy long-term capital. RU:Since that deal, we’ve had some significant moments in self-driving.Uber sold its autonomous driving unita few months after Zoox was acquired.General Motors closed down its Cruise robotaxi projectat the end of last year after executives were earlier found to have mishandled a collision incident. What does it tell us about the broader market? JL:When we started Zoox in 2014, we didn’t know it would be this expensive. We knew it would be hundreds of millions or low billions, but we wouldn’t have anticipated it probably being double-digit billions to develop, deploy and scale the technology. One thing we get reminded of over and over is the importance of doing things the right way, the respect you need for the safety case, for taking your time and being patient. Companies that have rushed or skipped steps have come to regret it. RU:Do you think Cruise skipped steps on safety? JL:At least the way they handled their incident seems like it left quite a bit to be desired. If you look at how quickly they attempted to scale from their first driverless vehicles on public roads to having hundreds of them in a short amount of time, probably that was not something that they were ready for, even though they had done an impressive job developing that technology. It’s a reminder that transparency is incredibly important. And there’s not going to be a lot of forgiveness for, again, skipping steps or not being forthcoming with information. RU:Uber now talks about this as a trillion-dollar market. They sold their self-driving unit. Do you feel like they were shortsighted? JL:Not necessarily. The capital requirements are no joke. And Uber, as large as it is, it’s taken them until about last year to start making money. The other thing is it’s very hard for companies to do autonomous driving as a side project. It’s tempting to say ‘oh this is existentially important for us, we’re going to invest in it’. But if the leadership of the company is not thinking about this every day, it’s really, really hard. RU:Uber has partnered with Waymo in a few cities. Could you see yourself partnering with a ride-hailing service such as Uber, or is the plan to go it alone? JL:We are building our own Zoox ride-hailing app and intend to offer a service directly to customers. That doesn’t mean we aren’t open to having conversations with other players. We do have regular conversations with other companies. RU:It sounds like you’re having active discussions with Uber. JL:We’ve talked to Uber and Lyft over the years. It would be strange if we refused to talk to them, right? We have really good relationships with both of those companies. RU:Cruise were developing a vehicle similar in some ways to Zoox. With them exiting the market, it leaves Zoox as one of the few US players with this vehicle type. Do you miss them? JL:It’s an interesting way of phrasing it. I do feel quite bad for the people who worked super hard at Cruise to develop that, and then now they’re not going to see it happen. We’ve probably been working on this for longer and thinking about it more deeply. And what I mean by that is, the Zoox vehicle that you rode in is a truly ground-up vehicle. Every single component of it was designed to be a robotaxi. If you look at the Origin [Cruise’s equivalent to Zoox’s vehicle], it was a half ground-up vehicle. So the chassis and the foundation of that was a car platform, and then they put a custom shell on it. Our fundamental belief is that Zoox is a better way to get around a city. It’s safer, more reliable and makes more economic sense, and people would much prefer to be in it. That’s been our bet since 2014. RU:Cruise’s exit means self-driving has mainly been left to Alphabet’s Waymo and Amazon’s Zoox in the US market. What does it mean to leave it in the hands of a few large technology companies? JL:It’s a reflection of the immense difficulty of the problem and the importance of having a safety case that can show that you’re meaningfully safer than humans. That’s a tall order. It’s way too big of a market for any one company. We’ve said that from the beginning. And, yes, there’s still going to be plenty of competition. RU:Both Uber and Cruise’s projects were curtailed by safety incidents. Zoox have been investigated for less serious incidents. The [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration] concluded one of those investigations earlier this year. How worried are you that a single serious incident could curtail the project? JL:Any time you’re operating on public roads, and busy ones like the Las Vegas Strip and San Francisco, you’re not going to be able to operate forever with no incidents. That’s not possible. What we look at is being many times better than humans at the core safety metrics like collisions, injuries, and ultimately fatalities. Our belief is, as long as we are able to maintain that type of a safety record, and as long as we are transparent with regulators and are upfront about how our system works, that we should be able to withstand the inevitable incidents that will occur over time. If we’re not many, many times safer than humans, that will be problematic for us. And frankly, it should be. I don’t believe that robotaxi operators should only be held to the same safety standard as the average human driver. The public has less patience for robotaxi mistakes than it does human mistakes. RU:You’re usinglidar[systems, which use pulsed laser light to help autonomous vehicles generate a three-dimensional map of the surrounding environment]. Waymo uses lidar. Aurora uses lidar. A couple of your competitors think that that’s just too expensive. Can you come to market without those components and still operate safely? JL:Nobody’s done it yet, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Zoox’s perspective is not that ours is the only way to do things. What I will say is that, again, we’re selling rides and not vehicles. When you look at the cost of sensors per trip, we’re talking about pennies. Even if you can solve human-level driving without those sensors, and nobody’s done that yet, but even if you could, we would much rather have the extra sensors, and have a significantly higher level of safety. And I think almost everybody would be willing to pay a certain number of pennies per mile for that extra amount of safety. That’s certainly our viewpoint. RU:Tesla wants to deploy robotaxis without those sensors this year. When I talk to industry figures, they say, we could get to the point where you didn’t need lidar, but it’s not coming in the next few months. What do you think of their approach? If there is an incident, does it risk undermining the whole self-driving effort? JL:I wouldn’t go that far. There is some element of we’re all in this together. So there’s certainly a hope and expectation that all of the serious players are taking safety seriously. I can’t speak for other companies. I can say that our approach has always been to give ourselves every opportunity to build a really safe vehicle. RU:Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is firing people at relevant government agencies overseeing self-driving technologies. Are you worried that the goalposts will shift under this administration? JL:I can’t comment on all of the internal dynamics. What I would say is that we’re having really positive and constructive conversations with all the different relevant regulatory agencies we work with. That includes NHTSA, it includes the [Departments of Motor Vehicles] in the states that we operate in, in California, the [California Public Utilities Commission]. And so we haven’t seen any reason to believe that that’s going to interfere with what we’re working on. RU:Could you see standards potentially diluted in a competitor’s favour? Is that something that you worry about? JL:That’s not something that we are anticipating. And I have faith in the US government to have the correct checks and balances and maintain public safety.

234,Uber wins multimillion-pound reprieve on disputed UK tax payments," Stephen Foleyin New York,Rafe Uddinin San Francisco andEmma Agyemangin London PublishedMay 10 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. The UK tax authorities have stopped collecting tens of millions of pounds a month in disputed VAT payments from Uber, after a setback in a related legal battle with the ridesharing app’s European rival Bolt. His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs has dropped its insistence thatUberkeep paying VAT on the full cost of rides, instead of just on the company’s cut of the fare, until the matter is resolved in court, according to a footnote in Uber’s latest quarterly financial statements. Uber and Bolt both contend that they should pay VAT only on their cut of a fare under the same rules that apply to tour operators, in a dispute that has added to the financial and legal ambiguity hanging overridesharingin the UK. The industry’s position received a boost in March when the UK’s upper tribunal fortaxruled that Bolt was indeed covered by the Tour Operators’ Margin Scheme, upholding a lower tribunal decision. HMRC said it was disappointed by the decision and was seeking permission to appeal. HMRC has demanded Uber pay VAT on whole fares since 2022 when the company was forced by a UK Supreme Court ruling to start treating drivers as employees. Every quarter, after Uber pays the lower amount it says it owes, the agency sends an “assessment” totalling more than £100mn to cover the difference. Uber has until now needed to pay the assessments “in order to proceed with the appeal process”, according to successive quarterly filings. The disputed amount it has paid now totals £1.4bn. “The payments do not represent our acceptance of the assessments,” it says. The company’s latest filing on Wednesday, however, revealed that the tax authorities had softened their position. “HMRC has expressed their intention to not enforce assessments pending the determination of the appeal of a competitor on a related matter,” Uber said. HMRC declined to comment on its change of stance, citing taxpayer confidentiality, but said: “When we appeal an adverse court decision we continue to take steps to protect revenue to ensure that we can collect the tax due if successful.” Uber declined to comment beyond its filing. Recommended The company generated roughly £5.3bn in revenue in the UK in 2023, according to its most recent public filings, about 18 per cent of its worldwide revenue that year. Uber began operating in the UK in 2012, three years after it was founded, but has faced strident opposition from more traditional taxi drivers. It is subject to a multimillion-pound lawsuit by London’s black-cab drivers who allege it improperly obtained a licence from Transport for London. Uber has said that the lawsuit was based on “completely unfounded” claims. ",,https://www.ft.com/content/d12f9b26-93ef-4873-9c3e-02d1db8adfd6,2025-05-11
235,Industry needs renewables to meet surging power demand from artificial intelligence," Martha Muirin New York PublishedMay 6 2025 Your guide to what Trump’s second term means for Washington, business and the world The US data centre industry has warned that the Trump administration’s crackdown on renewable energy could slow its growth and undermine Washington’s goal to win the global artificial intelligence race. Renewables have become a flashpoint since Donald Trump re-entered the White House, with his administration suspending clean energy developments on federal land, pausing federal loans and last month cancelling high-profile projects such as Equinor’s $5bn Empire Wind site. For tech companies struggling to secure reliable energy supplies to power and train AI, a clampdown on renewables could create power bottlenecks, drive up costs and push operators towards dirtier energy, experts said. Simon Ninan, senior vice-president at Hitachi Vantara, which builds equipment and infrastructure for data centres, said the Trump administration’s “antagonistic approach” towards renewable energy could make it “impossible to satisfy the data growth that’s happening”. “Strategically, the US could risk undermining its current pole position in the global AI race . . . China, on the other hand, has taken a proactive approach towards grid modernisation and efficient power distribution.” Energy shortages could “result in cancellation or delays in data centre build-outs or infrastructure upgrades”, he said. The Trump administration has warned thatlosing the AI raceto China is a bigger threat to the world than global warming and has advocated increasing the use of fossil fuels to power them. But experts warn it will be difficult to meet surging demand without adding a lot more renewable energy capacity, which is faster and cheaper to deploy than building gas power plants. The assault on renewables has alarmed Democratic leaders in north-eastern states, which are relying on the expansion of wind energy to meet future electricity demand. On Monday a coalition of Democratic attorneys-general from 17 states sued the Trump administration in an effort to block its attempt to end the development of wind energy. Data centres are expected to add 83.7 gigawatt of energy demand by 2030, equivalent to adding a new state the size of Texas to the grid, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank. While many companies are investing innuclear small modular reactortechnologies, it may be years before they are operational. “We’ve seen increased competition for green energy over the last couple of years,” said Nick Hertlein, a managing director at Stonepeak, an alternative investment firm specialising in infrastructure and real assets. “If US AI development is a priority, [policymakers] need to find ways to accommodate the data centre industry’s growth.” While large-scale gas generation projects are being fast-tracked by major grid operators such as PJM, MISO and ERCOT, this may come at the expense of cheaper sources such as renewables. Gas turbine suppliers such as Siemens and GE Vernova have warned lead times can stretch to 2029 for larger models. “If we can’t bring on new, lower-cost resources when demand is increasing, we’ll have to rely more and more on higher-cost resources,” said Rich Powell, chief executive of the Clean Energy Buyers Association. “We just need to flood the zone with new electricity as quickly as we can.” Although big participants in the technology industry may be able to lobby the administration to “loosen up” restrictions on new power sources, small to medium-sized players were in a “holding pattern” as they waited to see if permitting obstacles and tariffs on renewables equipment were lifted, said Ninan. “On average, [operators] are most likely going to try to find ways of absorbing additional costs and going to dirtier sources,” he said. Amazon, which is the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally, said carbon-free energy must remain an important part of the energy mix to meet surging demand for power, keep costs down and hit climate goals. “In addition to being a source of carbon-free energy, historically renewable energy has often been less expensive because there is no fuel to purchase,” said Kevin Miller, vice president of Global Data Centers at Amazon Web Services. Efforts by state and local governments to stymie renewables could also hit the sector. In Texas — the third-largest US data centre market after Virginia, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence — bills are being debated that increase regulation on solar and wind projects. “We have a huge opportunity in front of us with these data centres,” said Doug Lewin, president of Stoic Energy. “Virginia can only take so many, and you can build faster here, but any of these bills passing would kill that in the crib.” The renewables crackdown will make it harder for “hyperscale” data centres run by companies such as Equinix, Microsoft, Google and Meta to offset their emissions and invest in renewable energy sources. “Demand [for renewables] has reached an all-time high,” said Christopher Wellise, sustainability vice-president at Equinix. “So when you couple that with the additional constraints, there could be some near to midterm challenges.” Additional reporting Jamie SmythThis story has been amended to correct a quote from an Amazon web services executive ",,https://www.ft.com/content/6821ec83-3a33-4a20-a3c6-152135c8ad57,2025-05-11
236,Why travel didn’t bring the world together," Janan Ganesh PublishedMay 10 2025 Simply sign up to theLife & ArtsmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. AsIndia and Pakistanconfront each other again, I remember that VS Naipaul managed to upset both countries. And Argentina, east Africa, Islamic south-east Asia, the Caribbean, Iran. Few writers have seen more of the world. Few have found it more wanting. Some put this down to the western chauvinism of a man who named his cat after the first Roman emperor. For others, it was just a lucid mind at work. His prose stings because it tends not to do abuse, or even adjectives, so much as the patient accretion of telling detail. Either way, something that might be called the Naipaul paradox is going on in the modern world. Foreign travel has been growing for decades. But so has nationalism. This “shouldn’t” be true. Although no one except a fool or Mark Twain ever thought travel wasnecessarily“fatal to prejudice”, it was fair to expect a general lowering of enmities as people, and peoples, came into contact. To see how that is going, look around. The hardening of relations between China and the west from around 2012 came after an era of tourist and student traffic from the one place to the other. Brits and Italians are among the most prolific travellers in the world. Both countries have voted for propositions or parties that might be called nationalist over the past decade. In 1995, eight per cent of Americans were planning a foreign trip in the next six months. In 2023, more than a fifth were. In which of those two periods was the US more internationalist? Mark Zuckerberg’s belief that online contact would “bring the world closer together” has dated laughably. But at least people say so. It feels ruder, almost transgressive, to point out that travel has also flopped as a uniter of the species. In Europe, it is still a midwit dinner party applause line that such and such a percentage of Americans don’t have passports. Leaving aside the methodological problem here — the document wasn’t needed for some foreign trips until 2007 — so what? When 3 per cent held valid passports, the US voted for George HW Bush, the old China hand and CIA man, the most outward-looking of presidents. Now that nearing half do, Donald Trump is in the White House. If cross-border mingling by itself thickened the cord of human sympathy, Europe would have a more tranquil past Why did travel fail? The kindest answer is that other forces drove nationalism, such as immigration, and that things would be even tenser now without the great increase in travel. Another is that most of the increase is accounted for by people who were liberal-minded to begin with. Those most in need of foreign exposure are still dodging it. Each of these is a plausible line, but then so is a third: that travel should never have had such heroic claims made for it. If cross-border mingling by itself thickened the cord of human sympathy, Europe would have a more tranquil past. In other words, it is entirely possible to be a worldly jingo. It is possible to engage with another culture while rejecting it. Otherwise, the time that Lenin, Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai and the Islamist forerunner Sayyid Qutb spent in the west would have disarmed them, instead of heightening their awareness of difference. Travel is enormous fun. Besides that, it can be an educational top-up, if you arrive in a place with a foundation of reading. (And if you don’t over-index whatever you happen to observe in person.) But a connecting experience? A reminder of the essential oneness of humankind? If it were that, we should have expected national consciousness to recede, not surge, in the age of cheap flights, a dissolved Iron Curtain and a China that became porous in both directions. To explain this away, some will insist on the difference between crass “tourism” and real “travel”. Please. This has become a class distinction, nothing more, like that between “expats” and “immigrants”. Besides, Naipaul, at least before he turned into a cartoon of Great Manhauteur, put in the leg work. He is the postwar writer of English who makes even the best of the others appear to be playing at the job. If he recoiled from the world that he roamed, it seems he wasn’t, for once, exceptional. janan.ganesh@ft.com Find out about our latest stories first —follow FT Weekend onInstagramandX, andsign upto receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning",,https://www.ft.com/content/33e907bd-d6a9-43a2-9d96-c7709fea3a47,2025-05-11
237,Scientists use AI facial analysis to predict cancer survival outcomes," Michael Peelin London PublishedMay 8 2025 Simply sign up to theArtificial intelligencemyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Scientists have used artificial intelligence analysis of the faces of cancer patients to predict survival outcomes and in some cases outperform clinicians’ short-term life expectancy forecasts. The researchers used a deep learning algorithm to measure the biological age of subjects and found that the features of cancer sufferers appeared on average about five years older than their chronological ages. The new technological tool, known as FaceAge, is part of a growing push to use estimates of ageing in bodily organs as so-called biomarkers of potential disease risks. Advances in AI have boosted these efforts because of its ability to learn from large health data sets and make risk projections based on them. The research showed the information derived from pictures of faces could be “clinically meaningful”, said Hugo Aerts, co-senior author ofa paperon the study published in Lancet Digital Health on Thursday. “This work demonstrates that a photo like a simple selfie contains important information that could help to inform clinical decision-making and care plans for patients and clinicians,” said Aerts, director of AI in Medicine at Massachusetts-based Mass General Brigham. “How old someone looks compared to their chronological age really matters — individuals with FaceAges that are younger than their chronological ages do significantly better after cancer therapy”, he added. The scientists trained FaceAge on 58,851 photos of presumed healthy people from public data sets. They then tested the algorithm on 6,196 cancer patients, using photos taken at the start of radiotherapy. Among the cancer patients, the older the FaceAge, the worse the survival outcome, even after adjusting for chronological age, sex and cancer type. The effect was especially pronounced for people who appeared over 85. The scientists then asked 10 clinicians and researchers to predict whether patients receiving palliative radiotherapy for advanced cancers would be alive after six months The human assessors were right about 61 per cent of the time when they had access only to a patient photo, but that improved to 80 per cent when they had FaceAge analysis too. Possible limitations of FaceAge include biases in the data and the potential for readings to reflect errors in the model rather than actual differences between chronological and biological age, the research team said. The scientists are now testing the technology on a wider range of patients, as well as assessing its ability to predict diseases, general health status and lifespan. The study of biomarkers for ageing is a subject of intense research activity. In February, scientists unveiled a simple blood test to detect how fast internal organs age and help flag increased risks for 30 diseases, including lung cancer. Recommended Face ageing is an area of growing interest, with scientists exploring various techniques. One is the concept ofperceived ageing: in other words, how old a person looks to experienced healthcare professionals rather than how old they are biologically. Perceived ageing has emerged as a potential predictor of mortality and several age-related diseases, researchers say. The drawback is that generating the data by human observation is time-consuming and costly. The evaluation of FaceAge appeared to be “quite thorough”, said Jaume Bacardit, a Newcastle University AI specialist who has done workapplying the technologyto perceived ageing. But there needed to be more explanation of how the AI technique worked, to check for potential distorting factors, he added. “That is, which parts of the face are they basing their predictions on?” Bacardit said. “This will help identify potential confounders that may go undetected otherwise.”",,https://www.ft.com/content/3ac60aaf-3b55-4f1c-858c-7b42b4cbd914,2025-05-11
238,Eagerly awaited games console goes on sale in the US next month at a higher than expected $450," Leo LewisandDavid Keohanein Tokyo PublishedMay 8 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Nintendo said on Thursday it expected to sell 15mn units of its new Switch 2 console in its current fiscal year, undercutting market expectations as the Japanese video game company warned that US tariffs could wipe “tens of billions of yen” from profits. The first sales projection for the Switch 2 comes a month ahead of the games industry’s most-anticipated hardware launch this year. The new machine has attracted strong global pre-orders despite ahigher than expected$450 price tag in the US. Analysts say the next-generation launch on June 5 creates a “transformative” moment for Super Mario’s creator. But looming over it are the “reciprocal” tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump in early April that could force significant cost increases for a machine assembled in Vietnam, Cambodia and China. “It’s very tough for them to guess on sales figures this time around due to the tariff chaos,” said Serkan Toto, head of games consultancy Kantan Games. Nintendohad bet on shifting more of its production away from China toVietnam and Cambodiaafter the first Trump administration signalled it was willing to alter the terms of global trade. Nintendo’s president Shuntaro Furukawa warned on Thursday that if additional tariffs were imposed, any resultant increase in the console price could reduce demand in the US. He added that tariffs would have a negative impact on profits of “tens of billions of yen”. In a poll by Bloomberg, analysts predicted that on average Nintendo would sell 16.8mn units of the Switch 2 in the financial year ending in March 2026. Recommended Despite the tariff threat, Nintendo’s share price is up 32.5 per cent so far this year, with investors betting on the long-term ability of the company to persuade many of the 152mn people who bought the original Switch device to upgrade to its successor. The company will launch several titles with the new console, including the latest version of its blockbusterMario Kartseries. For the financial year just ended in March, at the end of its current console cycle, Nintendo’s operating profit fell 46.6 per cent year on year to ¥282.5bn ($1.95bn). The company expects operating profits to rise 13 per cent to ¥320bn in the current financial year.",,https://www.ft.com/content/0004b399-b6de-48a2-8a11-8a2aa2cc1a31,2025-05-11
239,Trump proposes to raise income taxes on wealthy Americans," James Politiin Washington PublishedMay 8 2025 UpdatedMay 9 2025 Your guide to what Trump’s second term means for Washington, business and the world Donald Trump has proposed raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, in a breach of Republican orthodoxy that he hopes could pay for broader tax breaks being debated in Congress. The US president proposed an increase in thetaxon people earning more than $2.5mn a year to almost 40 per cent, as he began talks with congressional Republicans on the details of a new fiscal package he hopes to pass this year, a person familiar with Trump’s thinking said on Thursday. The US president pushed the question of tax rises on to his party’s lawmakers in a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday. “The problem with even a ‘TINY’ tax increase for the RICH . . . is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming, ‘Read my lips,’ he posted — in a reference to George HW Bush’s pledge not to raise taxes in the 1988 election which ultimately hurt him politically. “In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I’m OK if they do!!!” Trump said of a tax increase. He said the tax increase was one “I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers”. Trump’s proposal would mark a major break from the traditional Republican low-tax approach to high earners — and drew criticism from some rightwing groups who said it was more akin to a Democratic policy. “The president is considering allowing the rate on individuals making $2.5mn or more to revert from 37 per cent to the pre-2017 39.6 per cent. This will help pay for massive middle- and working-class tax cuts, and protect Medicaid,” the person familiar with Trump’s thinking said, referring to the government healthcare plan for low-income households. It comes as the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill try to accelerate the fiscal package, which would extend Trump’s sweeping 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire next year. The tax bill is Trump’shighest legislative priorityon the economy but has been overshadowed early in his second term by the global trade war he launched on April 2, which included an array of high tariffs imposed on US trading partners. The negotiations among Republican lawmakers have also revealed disagreements over how to pay for the tax cuts and other measures in the package. As well as considering higher taxes for the wealthiest households, Trump has also signalled his willingness to end the preferential tax treatment of hedge fund and private equity profitsknown as “carried interest”, in a potential blow to Wall Street. Alongside the taxes on financiers and wealthy Americans, however, lawmakers are also consideringraising the “Salt cap”, a move that would allow property owners to deduct as much as $30,000 in state and local levies from their tax bill. Recommended The current limit of $10,000 was set in Trump’s 2017 tax package. The new limit would amount to a significant tax break in many prosperous US neighbourhoods. “It’s still an ongoing discussion amongst the members, and I think we’ll find the right point,” Mike Johnson, the Republican House Speaker, told reporters. Trump’s consideration of an increase in taxes for the wealthiest Americans drew a swift backlash from conservative anti-tax groups. “Raising the top tax rate to 39.6 per cent is a Kamala Harris proposal. She lost the election to President Trump. No need to adopt her tax hike,” said Americans for Tax Reform, which opposes all tax increases.",,https://www.ft.com/content/93a064db-624d-413f-a751-0b957f8e3cfa,2025-05-11
240,"Crime, divided leadership and problematic innovation could all hold back its potential"," Stephen Bush PublishedMay 6 2025 Simply sign up to theTechnologymyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. The underground railway is an unappreciated wonder of the world. Invented by private entrepreneurs in London in 1863 who were looking to make money transporting suburban commuters to work, it spread rapidly across the globe. One reason to visit New York’s Transit Museum is it not only reminds you of how impressive an endeavour the city’s subway (opened 1904) was but what an achievement all underground railways are. Sadly it also provides a sobering reminder that progress isn’t always inevitable. For those contemplating the future of another great wonder of the modern world — the open, public internet — the subway’s example suggests it might be nearer its peak than we think. A time traveller from New York in 1946 — the year that its subway reached peak ridership, a figure it has never since equalled — would find the modern version remarkably similar. (I would say “easy to navigate”, but of course the New York subway has never been easy to navigate.) The network is materially unaltered since then: it is just considerably grimier and suffering from decades of under-investment in infrastructure. In contrast, the peers it once mocked — an advert at its peak crowed about the absence of 24-hour service in Paris — have continued to break records for ridership into the 21st century (albeit with blows to their numbers since the pandemic). As a result of this, their services have continued to grow. The same time traveller in Tokyo, Milan, Paris or London would find many more services and lines than when they began their journey, while the one in New York would still struggle to get from Queens to Brooklyn. Don’t get me wrong, the subway is still a wonder of the world: but it is also, ultimately, a network that hasn’t yet lived up to its full potential. Why did this happen, and what might it have to do with the internet? Three things that have held back New York’s underground also threaten the promise of our online network. First is innovation elsewhere. Since the subway’s heyday, the cost of owning a car has dropped, and as a result the competition facing underground railways has become stronger. (A similar story lies behind the decline of buses across much of England.) The innovation that threatens the internet isn’t a competitor: it is the emergence of dangerous new predators that make using it fraught with risk. It is much easier to be fooled by deepfakes or misinformation, or lose out financially due to fraud or identify theft. The bad news for the internet is that these innovations are also harder to spot and to evade. Fraud of all types corrodes social trust and makes using the internet less and less rewarding. That is intimately linked to the second thing that has held back the subway: crime. The scale of the problem is often exaggerated but, nonetheless, last year 10 people weremurdered on the New York subway. Here, some politicians have aggravated the problem: parts of the left have long been naive about the problem of crime, how corrosive it is to public transport and community cohesion more broadly. In contrast, the internet’s crime problem is not because administrators are unaware of it: just ask anyone involved either in moderation or in law enforcement how much it worries them. But they lack the tools to keep fighting an ever more powerful and sophisticated threat. This leads to a third problem for both the subway and internet: dysfunctional and uncoordinated leadership. Transport in New York has been cursed by being one network with multiple governors: the city and the state have not worked together well, aggravating the system’s problems. Similarly, the ability to really combat digital crime involves a degree of international co-operation that seems very far from plausible right now. A frequent complaint I hear from both state and private cyber security professionals is that they have successfully tracked down criminals to their address, but the address is deep in another country. (One law enforcement official complained recently that their options in fighting fraud were often “do nothing, or start a land war in Russia”.) Unless or until there is more global co-operation on fighting fraud, this problem is going to get worse. That’s not to say that we will stop using the internet. After all, we still use the New York subway, despite the fact it is not as big as it should be, nor as clean, nor as safe. But those 1946 dreams of what the subway would be like in 80 years’ time have not been borne out. It seems more than likely that the internet in 2105 will have the same problem. stephen.bush@ft.com",,https://www.ft.com/content/3130d921-8ceb-46ee-a212-278ebf56d412,2025-05-11

242,China’s ageing population powers the insurance sector," PublishedMay 8 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. By 2035, almost a third of China’s population will be over the age of 60. A shrinking young workforce poses a policy challenge for the country, particularly for traditional growth engines such as manufacturing. Yet amid these broader concerns, one sector continues to shine: insurance. The same ageing trend that threatens productivity and strains its social security system is also fuelling demand for insurance products tailored to health and retirement. Unlike sectors tied to volatile trade cycles, life and health insurers are benefiting from long-term demographic tailwinds.Chinais expected to drive more than a quarter of global premium growth through to 2030, according to Bain estimates. At the same time, the insurance industry has emerged as one of the earliest and most significant beneficiaries of theartificial intelligencerevolution. Insurance is especially well-positioned to leverage advanced data analytics and machine learning to price risk more accurately and deliver personalised coverage. AI-driven insurers are using these technologies to offer tailored solutions by analysing user data such as health metrics and lifestyle habits to dynamically adjust policies and pricing. This digital transformation is already evident in the rapid growth of smaller technology-driven online insurers and brokers in China. One key example is Yuanbao, which uses more than 4,000 AI models to analyse health and lifestyle data to match users with personalised insurance products. Sales rose about two-thirds last year and its recent US listing, a rare move given delisting pressures and geopolitical tensions, should give it a boost as it seeks to scale further. Meanwhile, established giants may lag in digital innovation, but they remain some of the safest and most stable names in the sector. China Life, one of the country’s largest, more than doubled its net profit to Rmb106.9bn ($14.7bn) last year, supported by strong premium growth. Its core solvency ratio reached 153 per cent, well above regulatory standards in China. A 40 per cent rise in earnings in the first quarter of this year reflects sustained momentum. Despite these strengths, the sector is not without challenges. Lower interest rates have squeezed investment yields, undermining a key source of profitability. Meanwhile, traditional agent-based distribution models are under strain from digital disruption, forcing insurers to spend more to generate the same level of new business. Together with rising competition, these challenges have weighed on the sector’s share prices in recent months. Still, as China’s population ages and its manufacturing engine loses momentum, sectors that can leverage demographic change and digital innovation will stand out as rare bright spots. Insurance is one of the few that sits at that intersection. june.yoon@ft.com",,https://www.ft.com/content/2e6f247d-88d5-4d07-b496-67cc942350bd,2025-05-11
243,Remaining under the control of a non-profit board does not negate the risks of increasingly autonomous AI models," John Thornhill PublishedMay 8 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. It can be hard to train a chatbot. Last month, OpenAI rolled back an update to ChatGPT because its “default personality” was too sycophantic. (Maybe the company’s training data was taken from transcripts of US President Donald Trump’scabinet meetings. . .) The artificial intelligence company had wanted to make its chatbot more intuitive but its responses to users’ enquiries skewed towards being overly supportive and disingenuous. “Sycophantic interactions can be uncomfortable, unsettling, and cause distress. We fell short and are working on getting it right,” the company said in ablog post. Reprogramming sycophantic chatbots may not be the most crucial dilemma facing OpenAI but it chimes with its biggest challenge: creating a trustworthy personality for the company as a whole. This week, OpenAI was forced to roll back its latest planned corporateupdatedesigned to turn the company into a for-profit entity. Instead, it will transition to apublic benefit corporation, remaining under the control of a non-profit board. That will not resolve the structural tensions at the core of OpenAI. Nor will it satisfy Elon Musk, one of the company’s co-founders, who is pursuing legal action against OpenAI for straying from its original purpose. Does the company accelerate AI product deployment to keep its financial backers happy? Or does it pursue a more deliberative scientific approach to remain true to its humanitarian intentions? OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a non-profit research lab dedicated to developing artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity. But the company’s mission — as well as the definition of AGI — have since blurred. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, quickly realised that the company needed vast amounts of capital to pay for the research talent and computing power required to stay at the forefront of AI research. To that end, OpenAI created a for-profit subsidiary in 2019. Such was the breakout success of chatbot ChatGPT that investors have been happy to throw money at it, valuing OpenAI at$260bnduring its latest fundraise. With 500mn weekly users,OpenAIhas become an “accidental” consumer internet giant. Altman, who was fired and rehired by the non-profit board in 2023, now says that he wants to build a “brain for the world” that might require hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars of further investment. The only trouble with his wild-eyed ambition is — as the tech bloggerEd Zitronrants about in increasingly salty terms — OpenAI has yet to develop a viable business model. Last year, the company spent $9bn and lost $5bn. Is its financial valuation based on a hallucination? There will be mounting pressure on OpenAI from investors rapidly to commercialise its technology. Moreover, the definition of AGI keeps shifting. Traditionally, it has referred to the point at which machines surpass humans across a wide range of cognitive tasks. But in a recentinterviewwith Stratechery’s Ben Thompson,Altman acknowledged that the term had been “almost completely devalued”. He did accept, however, a narrower definition of AGI as an autonomous coding agent that could write software as well as any human. On that score, the big AI companies seem to think they are close to AGI. One giveaway is reflected in their own hiring practices. According toZeki Data, the top 15 US AI companies had been frantically hiring software engineers at a rate of up to 3,000 a month, recruiting a total of 500,000 between 2011 and 2024. But lately their net monthly hiring rate has dropped to zero as these companies anticipate that AI agents can perform many of the same tasks. A recentresearch paperfrom Google DeepMind, which also aspires to develop AGI, highlighted four main risks of increasingly autonomous AI models: misuse by bad actors; misalignment when an AI system does unintended things; mistakes which cause unintentional harm; and multi-agent risks when unpredictable interactions between AI systems produce bad outcomes. These are all mind-bending challenges that carry some potentially catastrophic risks and may require some collaborative solutions. The more potent AI models become, the more cautious developers should be in deploying them. How frontier AI companies are governed is therefore not just a matter for corporate boards and investors, but for all of us. OpenAI is still worryingly deficient in that regard, with conflicting impulses. Wrestling with sycophancy is going to be the least of its problems as we get closer to AGI, however you define it. john.thornhill@ft.com",,https://www.ft.com/content/49ad6c69-9b67-48da-a274-8408dfdaa7cb,2025-05-11
244,Deal is the latest in a series of large investments and acquisitions in the mobile gaming market," Tim Bradshawin London PublishedMay 7 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. London-based games developer Tripledot Studios is acquiring AppLovin’s games business for $800mn, in a deal that will vault the creator ofWoodokuandSolitaire.cominto the rankings of the world’s largest independent mobile games companies. US-based AppLovin, which is selling its games portfolio in order to focus on its core mobile advertising business, will take a $400mn stake in Tripledot as part of the deal, which is also funded through cash and debt. The deal values Tripledot at around $2bn. Tripledot will acquire a portfolio of 10 studios, including titles such asMatchington MansionandGame of War, that will take its annual total gross revenues — a measure of advertising income and players’ total in-app spending, before splits with distributors and other platform fees — to nearly $2bn. Its audience will more than double to more than 25mn daily active players. That will place Tripledot, which was founded in 2017, alongside the likes of Dream Games, Moon Active andPlayrix, among the world’s largest independent mobile games companies. “We are moving from the Championship to the Premier League,” said Lior Shiff, Tripledot’s chief executive and co-founder. The deal is the latest in a series of large investments and acquisitions in the mobile gaming market over the past few months, after Saudi-backed Scopely’s $3.5bnacquisitionof Niantic games includingPokémon Go, as well as private equity group CVC’s investment inDream Games, valuing the creator ofRoyal Matchat close to $5bn. The video games industry has faced a challenging period after the Covid-19 pandemic fuelled a surge in players and spending at the start of the decade. Thousands of games developers and other industry workers have been laid off in the last two years as companies adjust to a slower-growth era. Even the mobile games business, which has piggybacked on expanding global smartphone ownership for more than 15 years, has struggled, as overcrowded app stores make it harder for new releases to break through. According to Sensor Tower, a mobile market researcher, global mobile game downloads declined by 6 per cent last year to 49.6bn. The number of new releases reaching the top 1,000 mobile games in the US by downloads has fallen in recent years, Sensor Tower found, accounting for just over 10 per cent last year. That makes acquisitions of established games more attractive than taking the risk and high marketing cost of launching a brand new title. Tripledot has managed to defy the industry trends, Shiff said, by generating most of its revenue via advertising in games and a diversified portfolio of titles. “Despite the headwinds in the industry, we managed to have a really good year last year,” he said, adding that the acquisition would be “transformational”. Being a larger company will allow Tripledot to invest more in artificial intelligence to boost developer productivity and diversify its business model, with its revenue evenly split between advertising and players spending money in its games, for power-ups and other virtual items. Recommended In the most recent accounts available through the UK’s Companies House registry, Tripledot reported $339.9mn in revenues for 2023, up 15 per cent on the previous year, with $51.6mn in pre-tax profit. Adam Foroughi, AppLovin chief executive, said Tripledot’s team are “some of the best operators in the business”. While owning games studios helped train its AI models, “we’ve never been a game developer at heart”, he added. AppLovin was one of Wall Street’s top performing tech stocks last year, driven by rapid growth in its AI-powered ad targeting business. However, its shares have fallen by more than 40 per cent since mid-February after beinghitby short seller reports, which alleged AppLovin exaggerated its ad targeting system’s capabilities and had inflated the value and scale of its network. AppLovin has denied the allegations, saying the reports were “littered with inaccuracies and false assertions”, and has hired a law firm to investigate the short sellers’ activities.",,https://www.ft.com/content/065a2712-8f79-4b0c-9aa3-eff9276d316e,2025-05-11
245,Brace for disorder as the great power shifts begin," Timothy Garton Ash PublishedMay 9 2025 Simply sign up to theGeopoliticsmyFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. The writer is the author, most recently, of ‘Homelands: A Personal History of Europe’ A poem bequeathed us by the epically gloomy Canadian seer-singer Leonard Cohen ends with the words: “oh and one more thing / you aren’t going to like / what comes after / America”. As we pass the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war in Europe, every day brings further evidence that a remarkably long-lived US-led international order is over. Everyone is now scrambling to work out what might succeed it. A new multi-polar order? Spheres of influence? A worldwide version of the 19th-century Concert of Europe? By far the most plausible answer, however, is a prolonged and dangerous period of global disorder. Of course there never was a golden age of universal liberal international order. But across large areas of the world, in Europe, Asia and Oceania, there was a security and economic order led by the “liberal leviathan”, as the Princeton scholar John Ikenberry dubbed the post-1945 US. This order, which reached its zenith at the beginning of this century, has been declining for some time, partly because of the “rise of the rest”, itself facilitated by US-led globalisation, and partly due to America’s own hubristic self-harming. President Donald Trump is now tearing down what remains of the edifice with unparalleled speed and recklessness. Even in the unlikely event that American democracy emerges unscathed from four years of Trumpian revolution, so far as relations between the US and its allies are concerned it will be “never glad confident morning again” (to quote Robert Browning’sThe Lost Leader). With three or potentially even four significant wars now raging (Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan, nuclear-armed India and Pakistan facing off over Kashmir) and trade-stopping three-digit tariffs between the world’s two largest economies, who can doubt that we’re currently in a period of dangerous disorder? Some still hope that we will emerge from it fairly soon, either by a miraculous restoration of the former order or by the creation of a new one. Well, let’s hope, but here are several good reasons to doubt it. Even if a rising superpower (China) and a relatively declining superpower (the US) are not fated to fall into the“Thucydides trap”and go to war, periods of great power shifts almost invariably bring increased international tensions. The leaders of China and Russia have just marked the end of the European part of the second world war by meeting in Moscow to reaffirm their partnership against the west. Xi Jinping even equates the “arrogant fascist forces” defeated in 1945 with today’s “unilateralism, hegemony and bullying”. (Guess whose?) Russia now has a war economy and Vladimir Putin is bent on restoring as much as he can of the Russian empire. Narendra Modi’s India has its own nationalist ambitions and an obsessive enmity towards Chinese-backed Pakistan. Beside these rivalrous great powers, there’s an array of middle powers such as Turkey, Brazil and South Africa. Strikingly, these countries often see opportunities in the new disorder. They can align with one great power for one purpose, another for another, all the time advancing their own goals. Meanwhile, small states like those in the Gulf can play with and between all the big powers, like the Egyptian plover bird which flourishes by cleaning the detritus between crocodiles’ teeth. For 80 years since nuclear weapons were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the taboo on their use has held. But as the world watches a major war being waged by a nuclear-armed Russia against Ukraine, a country that voluntarily gave up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for security assurances from the US, UK and (blackest comedy) Russia, the fragile dam against nuclear proliferation seems likely to burst. South Korea, agonising over what Russia has promised North Korea in return for substantial military support against Ukraine, has an active debate about acquiring nuclear weapons — and the technology to do it. The subject is on many minds in the Middle East, as that region teeters between a nuclear-armed Israel and a nuclear-threshold Iran, while Europeans are beginning to feel they need their own nuclear umbrella. Meanwhile, a continued technological revolution generates new dimensions of geopolitical rivalry, including control over data, software and communication networks. AI, in particular, brings the danger of a new arms race, more unpredictable than the cold war’s nuclear one. If China can surprise the US with a DeepSeek, why could it not secretly develop a DeepStrike? Continued population growth and climate change will exacerbate competition for resources and pressures for mass migration. To be sure, there are countervailing forces. China has an obvious economic interest in preserving an open world trading system from which it has been the biggest single beneficiary. Even the most opportunistic middle powers must fear disorder becoming total breakdown. There are encouraging signs of a liberal fightback in Canada, Australia and Europe. Pope Leo XIV promises to “build bridges” on a troubled earth. Nothing in history is inevitable. Yet those of us who believe in the never fully realisable ideal of liberal international order will be well advised to assume that the melancholy Cohen was right. We should actively prepare for a protracted period of global disorder.",,https://www.ft.com/content/e45091ae-31c7-46b2-95bb-b8197655cd33,2025-05-11

247,US scraps Biden-era rule that aimed to limit exports of AI chips," Michael Actonin San Francisco andDemetri SevastopuloandJames Politiin Washington PublishedMay 7 2025 UpdatedMay 7 2025 Your guide to what Trump’s second term means for Washington, business and the world The US intends to scrap a rule put in place by the Biden administration that aimed to limit exports of artificial intelligence chips and threatened to weigh on the sales of semiconductor groups such as Nvidia and AMD. A US official said on Wednesday that the planned regulation, which was due to take effect on May 15, was full of red tape that made it “unenforceable”. Instead, the Trump administration intends to overhaul the rule. The move by Washington comes as the new administration takes a more lenient approach to the regulation of AI and other advanced technologies domestically and contends with the rise of Chinese companies in the sector. Changes to the rule, known as the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, would represent relief for the likes ofNvidia. The chip powerhouse would otherwise be subject to limits on the amount of AI hardware it could sell in countries such as India, Switzerland and Singapore. The company has enjoyed sustained and frenzied demand for its graphics processing units, which has propelled it to one of the world’s most valuable companies within just a couple of years. Instead of allowing the Biden-era controls to take effect in a week, the official said the Trump administration would draft a rule that would ensure that US technology flourished without allowing American adversaries to gain access to the technology. The official cautioned that the rule would not be imminent and would take some time to put in place. The export controls, introduced in the last days of Joe Biden’s presidency, created a three-tier licensing system for AIchipsused in data centres, such as Nvidia’s powerful GPUs. They were aimed at making it harder for Chinese companies to circumvent US export controls by accessing them via third countries, in a climate of geopolitical rivalry over the infrastructure that powers artificial intelligence. The planned legislation imposed a cap on chip export volumes for all but a small number of countries, which include G7 members and Taiwan. More than 100 countries fell into this “middle” tier. The EU, Nvidia and the wider chip and technology industry criticised the rules, which were undergoing an industry feedback period. The rules, they said, would instead givean advantage to Chinese competitorssuch as Huawei as they developed and sell their own AI hardware, foregoing an opportunity to ensure that much of the world would rely on American technology. “We welcome the administration’s leadership and new direction on AI policy,” said an Nvidia spokesperson. “With the AI Diffusion Rule revoked, America will have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the next industrial revolution and create high-paying US jobs, build new US-supplied infrastructure and alleviate the trade deficit.” The company’s shares closed 3 per cent higher on Wednesday following the news, while AMD added 1.8 per cent. The most powerful chips from Nvidia are already banned from export to China following successive performance-based restrictions under the Biden administration. Recommended The Trump administration last month introduced new licence requirements for less powerful chips specifically designed for the China market by Nvidia and AMD to comply with export controls. Nvidia said the ban on its H20 chips resulted in a$5.5bn hit to its earnings. A broadernational security reviewinto potential new semiconductor tariffs is also under way, following a temporary exemption from the most extreme “reciprocal” duties on US trade partners. Nvidia is set to announce its first-quarter results on May 28. Additional reporting by Rafe Uddin in San Francisco",,https://www.ft.com/content/bb8846e0-4506-433f-86a3-4877ad63fc32,2025-05-11
248,Business school teaching case study: taking accountancy from spreadsheets to AI," By Martin Mulyadi and Yunita Anwar PublishedMay 8 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Martin Mulyadi is a professor of accounting and Yunita Anwar is an assistant professor of accounting at Shenandoah University School of Business, Winchester, Virginia A spate ofaudit failureshas highlighted that traditional auditing approaches may no longer be fit for today’s financial world. But whileresearchsuggests artificial intelligence has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of auditing practices, without robust governance frameworks, proper training, ethical AI practices and human oversight, the technology also brings big risks for auditors. AI has the potential to transform auditing practices in a way that is analogous to the impact of thebirth of the digital spreadsheet. By automating calculations, that development in 1979 gave accountants more time for decision-making, changing their role in the business world. AI could have a similarly transformative effect. Daniel Davies, managing director at the consultancy Frontline Analysts,describes a futurein which AI will unspin the dense data in annual reports, turning static and often unclear documents into dynamic, interactive tools. AI, he says, can sort through huge amounts of financial data, making it possible to spot patterns and inconsistencies. This is part of aseriesof regular business school-style teaching case studies devoted to business dilemmas. Read the text and the articles from the FT and elsewhere suggested at the end (and linked to within the piece) before considering the questions raised. The series forms part of a wide-ranging collection of FT ‘instant teaching case studies’ that explore business challenges. Driven by prospects of enhanced productivity, accountancy firms are investing billions in developing AI tools to handle routine tasks autonomously and are making these integral to their operations. They are also partnering with tech companies such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, Oracle and Salesforce to integrate AI into their core services. Accountancy firms are starting to see the benefits. For example, an AI fraud-detection systemtrialled by EYwith 10 UK audit clients flagged suspicious activities at two of those companies. In both cases, the clients later confirmed fraud had occurred, suggesting that AI could dramatically improve audit quality by catching irregularities that traditional methods overlook. As Accenture and Grant Thornton have found, AI also offersefficiency gains. Thomson Reuters beta testers have reportedly halved sample sizes and testing time for certain procedures, while Deloitte believes AI could release its finance agents from thousands of hours’ of work annually, potentially cutting costs by up to 25 per cent. Automating the tedious process of sifting through mountains of data enables auditors to focus on higher risk areas and make complex judgments, allowing accountants to work as strategic advisers using human knowledge to support AI analytics. AI can analyse full data sets, rather than relying on historical sampling, making it easier for auditors to zero in on anomalies. It can also streamline the process of pitching for new business by drawing on databases of past work, which could increase efficiency and profitability. The ‘black box’ nature of AI — the absence of visibility in training data and methods — makes it hard to understand how and why AI technologies arrive at their conclusions However, AI-powered systems also create dilemmas. One academicstudyidentifies challenges such as the bias embedded within AI algorithms and warns auditors to ensure that the decisions they make are fair, accountable and transparent. For example, as anempirical studysuggests, the application of large language models to mortgage underwriting has led to higher rejection rates and interest rates for Black borrowers compared to otherwise identical white borrowers. Another concern is the “black box” nature of AI — the absence of visibility in training data and methods. As noted by theCenter for Audit Quality, this makes it hard to understand how and why AI technologies arrive at their conclusions. Furthermore, AI technologies are probabilistic — they predict a response rather than retrieving factual data like a search engine. This means that asking the same question multiple times can yield different answers and produce “hallucinations”, or inaccuracies. AI can deliver inconsistent results either because data has been incorrectly structured or because processes are not standardised. Onestudywarns that over-reliance on AI without adequate human scrutiny — often referred to as “human-in-the-loop” — the technology could undermine auditors’ ability to identify nuanced irregularities or fraud.Deloitte and KPMGhave voiced similar concerns, arguing that if AI is trained on past cases of fraud, it may not detect new forms of fraud designed to circumvent existing safeguards. Companies need to balance automation and human judgment, equipping employees to evaluate AI outputs and understand the limitations As a result, firms must tread carefully when incorporating AI into accounting and reporting. Robust governance, ethical oversight and good data management are essential. Meanwhile, companies need to balance automation and human judgment, which means equipping employees to evaluate AI outputs and understand the technology’s limitations. Implementing AI also requires a holistic strategy driven by senior leadership. All this comes with high costs and an uncertain return on investment. Yet companies that are slow to adopt AI in auditing alsoface riskssuch as lower levels of efficiency and audit quality, according to accountancy training firm Mercia Group. Meanwhile, firms may encounter difficulties hiring top talent, since employees increasingly prefer to work with new technologies. While AI offers the potential for increased productivity and efficiency, incorporating AI in accounting and auditing presents many challenges. Accounting and auditing professionals must weigh the transformative power of AI-powered systems against the responsibilities and risks that come with using them.

249,Senior executive says tech group is looking at start-up options for iPhone and Safari browser," Tim Bradshawin London PublishedMay 7 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Shares in Google’s parent Alphabet fell by as much as 9 per cent on Wednesday after a top Apple executive said the iPhone maker was “looking at” introducing alternative search engines for its web browser powered by artificial intelligence. Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice-president of services, told a US court that the company was talking toAIstart-ups such as Perplexity about offering their search tools as an alternative to Google. Cue said thatAppleplanned to “add them to the list” of tools that iPhone and iPad owners can choose to set as their preferred option to search the web through its Safari browser, without giving a timeframe for the potential move. Apple was also considering adding AI services from China’s DeepSeek to the iPhone, he said, among other options. A shift to new search providers would threaten Alphabet’s multibillion-dollar relationship with Apple, under whichGoogleis the default search engine for iPhones and the Safari browsers. The deal brings Google hundreds of millions of users and boosts its advertising business. Shares in Alphabet closed 7.5 per cent lower in New York, while Apple slipped 1.1 per cent. The share price falls came after Bloomberg earlier reported Cue’s comments. Cue was testifying as part of a hearing to determine antitrust remedies after the US Department of Justice’s legal victory against Google last year. A federal judgeruledlast August that Google maintained an illegal monopoly in search through deals with wireless carriers, browser developers and device manufacturers. Apple stands to take a multibillion-dollar hit to its profits if its deal with Google is unwound as a result of the ruling. Google pays as much as $20bn a year to Apple to be its default search engine. The long-standing deal between the two Silicon Valley companies was central to the US government’s case. Apple has introduced several new generative AI tools to the iPhone over the past year, including access to OpenAI’s ChatGPT through its Siri assistant. However, other features, including a broader upgrade to Siri, have beendelayed, fuelling fears among some investors that Apple is falling behind rivals such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft in the generative AI race. Recommended AI tools offer users complete written answers to search queries, backed up by supporting links, rather than Google’s traditional list of web pages. Google has also upgraded its search engine to incorporate results using generative AI. In Wednesday’s testimony, Cue said that AI had opened the door to serious competition to Google in search for the first time and that Apple had discussed adding various AI features to the iPhone from a range of new providers, including Perplexity, Anthropic, China’s DeepSeek and Elon Musk’s xAI. “The market reaction highlights investor jitters over the impact of conversational AI apps on Google’s traditional search business, which is the company’s financial workhorse,” said Colin Sebastian, analyst at Baird, in a note. “What we believe is less appreciated is the challenge in building an advertising business on top of search and AI . . .

250,Nintendo predicts 15mn Switch 2 sales in tariff-hit first year," Leo LewisandDavid Keohanein Tokyo PublishedMay 8 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Nintendo said on Thursday it expected to sell 15mn units of its new Switch 2 console in its current fiscal year, undercutting market expectations as the Japanese video game company warned that US tariffs could wipe “tens of billions of yen” from profits. The first sales projection for the Switch 2 comes a month ahead of the games industry’s most-anticipated hardware launch this year. The new machine has attracted strong global pre-orders despite ahigher than expected$450 price tag in the US. Analysts say the next-generation launch on June 5 creates a “transformative” moment for Super Mario’s creator. But looming over it are the “reciprocal” tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump in early April that could force significant cost increases for a machine assembled in Vietnam, Cambodia and China. “It’s very tough for them to guess on sales figures this time around due to the tariff chaos,” said Serkan Toto, head of games consultancy Kantan Games. Nintendohad bet on shifting more of its production away from China toVietnam and Cambodiaafter the first Trump administration signalled it was willing to alter the terms of global trade. Nintendo’s president Shuntaro Furukawa warned on Thursday that if additional tariffs were imposed, any resultant increase in the console price could reduce demand in the US. He added that tariffs would have a negative impact on profits of “tens of billions of yen”. In a poll by Bloomberg, analysts predicted that on average Nintendo would sell 16.8mn units of the Switch 2 in the financial year ending in March 2026. Recommended Despite the tariff threat, Nintendo’s share price is up 32.5 per cent so far this year, with investors betting on the long-term ability of the company to persuade many of the 152mn people who bought the original Switch device to upgrade to its successor. The company will launch several titles with the new console, including the latest version of its blockbusterMario Kartseries. For the financial year just ended in March, at the end of its current console cycle, Nintendo’s operating profit fell 46.6 per cent year on year to ¥282.5bn ($1.95bn). The company expects operating profits to rise 13 per cent to ¥320bn in the current financial year.",,https://www.ft.com/content/0004b399-b6de-48a2-8a11-8a2aa2cc1a31,2025-05-11

252,China’s J-10 ‘Dragon’ shows teeth in India-Pakistan combat debut," Mehul SrivastavaandCharles Cloverin London, andHumza Jilaniin Islamabad PublishedMay 9 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Even before the fog of war had begun to lift, the Chengdu Aircraft Company’s stock had started to soar. Almost three decades after first taking to the skies, the Chinese plane-maker’s first fighter jet, the J-10 Vigorous Dragon, had finally seen combat — and survived. By 4amon May 7, Chinese diplomats in Islamabad were at the foreign ministry, poring over results from the first face-off between modern Chinese warplanes, replete with missiles and radars untested in battle, and advanced western hardware deployed byIndia. As evidence mounted, while remaining inconclusive, that a Pakistani pilot in the latest variant of the Vigorous Dragon may have shot down India’s French-made Rafale jet, Chengdu’s share price leapt more than 40 per cent in just two days. “There’s no better advertisement than a real combat situation,” said Yun Sun, a specialist in Chinese military affairs at the Stimson Center in Washington DC. “This came as a pleasant surprise for China . . . the result is quite striking.” While India andPakistanmay be embroiled in their deepest skirmish in decades, the conflict is also a testing ground for equipment crucial to a different rivalry — that between China and the US-led western alliance. About 81 per cent of Pakistan’s military equipment comes from China, including more than half its 400-strong fighter and ground attack aircraft, according to estimates by the Stockholm Peace Research Institute and the International Institute for Strategic Studies. That reflects an “all weather friendship” that China has cultivated since the 1960s with Pakistan to try and ringfence India. The materiel it provides Pakistan has evolved alongside China’s own defence industry, said Andrew Small, an expert on Pakistan-China relations at the German Marshall Foundation. “Aside from the co-operation on nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, a lot of what China supplied used to be low-end stuff — tanks, artillery, small arms,” said Small. Now, however, Pakistan “is becoming a showcase for some of China’s newer capabilities”. Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings. India, meanwhile, has emerged as the world’s largest weapons importer as its wealth and regional ambitions have grown. Over the past decade, it has shifted from a reliance on Russian suppliers to the US, France and Israel for almost half of its own recent purchases, including sophisticated fighter jets, transport aircraft and combat and surveillance drones. “This is the most important global aspect here — this is the first time Chinese military equipment has been tested against top notch western equipment,” said Sushant Singh, lecturer at South Asian Studies at Yale University. “Whenever and however this ends, the balance sheet will tell us what will happen in Taiwan, and which direction should western defence companies go to counter the low cost and high tech capabilities that the Chinese have shown.” When countries go to war, their allies watch and learn. After Ukraine repelled a nearly 50-mile column of Russian armour — tanks, armoured vehicles and others — using modern, shoulder-fired British and American missiles, Indian diplomats in Kyiv were monitoring it closely. “Is it true what they say about Russian tanks — clumsy, easily lolly-popped,” one asked an FT journalist returning from the frontline, referring to how missiles would blow the tops off tanks. When Taiwan saw how effective the US-made Himars medium-range precision missile system was at hitting Russian targets behind the frontline, it lobbied to move up the delivery of its own orders. By next year, it will own almost 30 of the truck-mounted systems — which is more than Ukraine. Even short skirmishes, such as those India and Pakistan have regularly fought, serve a unique purpose. Enemies test each other, and show off their own capabilities, seeking to enforce existing red lines and set new ones. They generate vast amounts of operational data that shapes the next skirmish — or wins the next war. Allies share that data and arms manufacturers analyse it, tweaking their own weapons systems. Defence attachés from China’s western rivals were waiting “impatiently”, said one in New Delhi, for India to share the radar and electronic signatures of the J-10C while in combat mode so that their own aerial defences could be trained on it. Similarly for China, this skirmish was a test not just of the aircraft but the sophisticated radar system — called an active electronically scanned array — mounted in the front of the plane. The combat tested its ability to not just hunt out threats but help guide the missiles. Aurangzeb Ahmed, Pakistan’s deputy chief of air operations, said PL-15 variants were among the missiles used in the skirmish this week. The hour-long engagement would be “studied in the classroom”, bragged Ahmed. “We knocked some sense into these guys.” Robert Tollast, a researcher at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said the use of PL-15E missile could be “highly significant”. Indian media reported that an intact PL-15 had been recovered, providing a chance to study its secrets. “If confirmed, we have now seen the demonstration of a Chinese-made AESA on a beyond-visual-range-missile, used in combat,” he said. Western nations and Russia have been battle testing their versions of AESA’s for decades. Details of just this single skirmish — such as how many missiles were fired to successfully hit a target — “could be tremendously useful for the Chinese in evaluating the capability of this weapon”, Tollast said. Neither the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, nor Chengdu Aircraft responded to a request for comment. On the other side of the ledger, the success of Indian missiles — many of them reportedly long-range French SCALP missiles — in finding their targets showed both the weakness and paucity of Pakistani aerial defences. Pakistan is known to deploy China’s HQ-9 systems, which are a generation behind the sophistication of Russian S-400s and are at the top-end of India’s inventory. “The fact is that even at a time of extreme high alert, Indian missiles penetrated Pakistani airspace without being detected,” said Laxman Kumar Behera, who specialises on India’s national security at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. India’s retaliation on Thursday targeted Pakistan’s “air defence radars and systems at a number of locations in Pakistan”, according to the Indian military. “That’s a very precise display of a very high-end capability — taking out the defences, rather than an actual target,” said a senior western diplomat based in Delhi. “It’s a carefully calibrated warning — it says, look, if we can come take the lock off your door, then we can come into the house whenever we want.” Both India and Pakistan have gleaned crucial details about their rival’s strengths from past clashes — and identified weaknesses of their own. After India successfully wrested back territory in the Himalayas from a Pakistani encroachment in 1999, an internal inquiry showed its ageing Russian fleet of MiG’s struggled to manoeuvre in the mountain passes, or find targets in the snow while evading shoulder mounted missiles. Three aircraft were shot down in three days before India switched to French Mirages — the first deployment of precision and laser guided missiles by the Indian Air Force, and the beginning of a shift away from Russian to western aircraft. Similarly, after India responded to the 2019 killing of 40 security personnel by a Pakistan-based militant group with air strikes in the Balakot region of Pakistan, it not only lost a MiG 21 aircraft but its forces mistakenly shot down a helicopter in a friendly fire incident, killing seven. “The officers of the Pakistani army have looked after me very well — they are thorough gentlemen,” the captured pilot was shown saying in a propaganda video before his release. “And the tea is fantastic.” The two incidents underscored that India lacked sufficient airborne early warning and control systems — planes that fly at high altitudes carrying sophisticated radars and sensors that can detect enemy aircraft, missiles and drones at range. But India’s bureaucratic challenges made learning from each skirmish difficult, and inefficient, as compared to a simpler procurement system for Pakistan, which has one main supplier — China — and a military that dominates the country. Only in March this year did India issue an “acceptance of necessity” notice to triple India’s fleet of such early warning aircraft to 18. Their deployment is years away. “If these tit-for-tat aerial retaliations continue for much longer, India will feel their absence sorely,” said a second western defence attaché based in New Delhi. “If it turns out that India lost a French jet to a Chinese missile fired from over 100km away, then that need is clearly urgent.” Comments have not been enabled for this article.",,https://www.ft.com/content/ff46ca13-a64d-4ba1-833e-1bb348880aec,2025-05-11
253,"Dogecoin, XRP Slump as Crypto Profit-Taking Continues Ahead of Friday's Inflation Data","BitcoinBTC$109,832.00was just 1% lower in the past 24 hours, while XRPXRP$2.33and dogecoinDOGE$0.22897slipped 2.5% each, signaling a tepid recovery rather than a firm rebound. Markets were jolted late last week after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed raising tariffs on European imports to 50%, up from a previously discussed 20%. “Bitcoin's rebound came after Trump decided to delay imposing new EU tariffs, which had initially sparked a market downturn over the weekend,” Jeffrey Ding, chief analyst at HashKey Group, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Traders see these macroeconomic events as a welcome stability boost, encouraging a risk-on sentiment, especially as MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor hinted at upcoming Bitcoin purchases,” Ding added. Markets calmed somewhat on Monday after Trump announced he would delay the implementation of new tariffs until July 9, citing a ""constructive call"" with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Still, Singapore-based QCP Capital warned in a market broadcast message late Monday that the episode is a reminder of how quickly policy shocks can unwind market calm. The BTC July-to-June implied volatility spread, which spiked above 2 vols last week, has now compressed to below 1 — suggesting traders are watching closely for another pivot ahead of the new deadline. The vol spread refers to the difference in expected volatility between July and June bitcoin options, showing how much more (or less) traders expect price swings in July compared to June. All eyes are now on this Friday’s Core PCE print, a key inflation gauge for the Federal Reserve, the firm noted. The index is a measure of inflation that excludes the volatile prices of food and energy — and is considered a key indicator used by the Fed to assess inflation and make policy decisions. Despite the uncertainty, spot ETF inflows remain steady, with BlackRock’s IBIT logging 30 consecutive days of net inflows — a rare streak that underscores sticky institutional interest. Still, crypto’s resilience has been relative, not absolute. QCP noted a divergence between digital assets and traditional tech as flows have turned cautious in products like the TQQQ NASDAQ ETF, even as crypto held its ground. “In a world of erratic policymaking,” QCP wrote, “crypto increasingly looks like the grown-up at the table.” Shaurya is the Co-Leader of the CoinDesk tokens and data team in Asia with a focus on crypto derivatives, DeFi, market microstructure, and protocol analysis.Shaurya holds over $1,000 in BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX, SUSHI, CRV, NEAR, YFI, YFII, SHIB, DOGE, USDT, USDC, BNB, MANA, MLN, LINK, XMR, ALGO, VET, CAKE, AAVE, COMP, ROOK, TRX, SNX, RUNE, FTM, ZIL, KSM, ENJ, CKB, JOE, GHST, PERP, BTRFLY, OHM, BANANA, ROME, BURGER, SPIRIT, and ORCA.He provides over $1,000 to liquidity pools on Compound, Curve, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, BurgerSwap, Orca, AnySwap, SpiritSwap, Rook Protocol, Yearn Finance, Synthetix, Harvest, Redacted Cartel, OlympusDAO, Rome, Trader Joe, and SUN.

256,"Alpaca Finance, Once a DeFi Giant on BNB Chain, Will Shut Down","Alpaca Finance, once a cornerstone on the BNB Chain and an early leader in leveraged yield farming, will shut down operations by the end of 2025 due to an unsustainable business model amid a more competitive and capital-intensive DeFi landscape. Theprotocol saidMonday that it will begin winding down all products, including its original yield farming platform, automated vaults, and decentralized perpetuals, over the next few months. Front-end access will remain available through December 31, 2025, to give users time to withdraw their assets. “This choice wasn’t made lightly,” the Alpaca team wrote. “But we believe it is the most responsible course of action to safeguard our community and ensure a graceful and secure wind-down.” Launched during decentralized finance's (DeFi) 2021 boom, Alpaca quickly rose to prominence on BNB Chain, offering leveraged yield farming strategies that allowed users to amplify returns by borrowing capital to farm liquidity pool (LP) tokens. At its peak, Alpaca held over $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) and was one of the most-used protocols on the chain. Internally, Alpaca had been operating at a loss for over two years, according to the team, with revenue tied directly to protocol usage — a challenge compounded by the project’s fair launch structure with no VC backing or pre-mined tokens. The final blow came in late April, when Binance delisted ALPACA, the protocol’s native token. While the event triggered a brief 550% price rally due to short liquidations, including $55 million in forced closures in a single day, it also severely restricted liquidity and user access to the token. That, the team said, made it harder to pursue new initiatives or strategic mergers. “We explored M&A discussions with several projects, and some progressed meaningfully,” the team said. “But as the market turned downward again in early 2025, those deals fell through.” ALPACA, the project’s token, was last trading at approximately $0.08, down over 90% from its all-time high in 2021.

The so-called flippening is characterized by XMR's market capitalization topping $7.5 billion, racing ahead of TON's $7.48 billion and LTC's $7.35 billion,according to data source Coingecko. Monero (XMR) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency with privacy-enhancing technologies to obscure transaction details. That makes traditional financial tracking and intercepting methods largely obsolete, which explains why criminals love cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, a media outlet linked to the Islamic State (ISIS) Pakistan Province reportedly published a poster calling for contributions of ""jihad with wealth"" andsought donationsin monero. Still, prices for the controversial coin have risen over 100% to above $400 this year, hitting levels last seen in early 2021, CoinDesk data show. The rally has beensupposedly led byoptimism about the impending privacy upgrade and rumors of re-listing by major exchanges, including the U.S.-listed Coinbase. Meanwhile, litecoin (LTC), considered silver to bitcoin's gold, has dropped 6% this year to trade below $100. Toncoin, which is deeply integrated into the social messaging app Telegram's economy, has dropped 25% this year.

258,"Asia Morning Briefing: Thai Banks May Soon Hold Crypto, SCB 10X CEO Signals Sandbox Push","Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, seeCoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Uniswap's UNI token surged from $6.00 to $6.65 over the past 24 hours, pushing the token up 5%, while the broader market gauge CoinDesk20 Index fell 1.8% in the last 24 hours. This momentum coincides with Uniswap recording its highest monthly transaction volume since February, processing over $73 billion in trades and generating more than $380 million in revenue this year, as institutional interest grows and a notable whale re-entered the market byacquiring nearly $4 million worth of UNI. Kaweewut Temphuwapat, the new CEO of SCB 10X, the venture arm of Thailand's SCB bank, sees significant opportunities emerging at the intersection of AI, crypto, and Web3. ""We definitely [are] going more on AI and also crypto and AI plus crypto,"" Temphuwapat told CoinDesk, highlighting these hybrid investments as firmly ""under our radar."" He predicts clearer crypto regulation in the U.S. will fuel increased deal flow into resilient Asian markets, noting SCB 10X's early success investing in Ripple: ""We are an early investor in Ripple of 10 years ago… we've used that technology for the last five to six years in our SCB App."" Temphuwapat praised Thailand’s proactive and innovative regulators, highlighting the country's robust payments infrastructure. He expects Thai banks, including SCB, could soon directly hold crypto tokens on their balance sheets, initially through regulatory sandboxes. Pseudonymous trader ""James Wynn,"" known for high-stakes crypto bets on decentralized platform Hyperliquid, has shifted focus from billion-dollar bitcoin positions to memecoins, recently placing a leveraged $1 million bet on Pepe (PEPE),CoinDesk reported earlier. Previously, Wynn closed a massive $1.2 billion bitcoin long position at a $17.5 million loss, before pivoting to a $1 billion short position at 40x leverage, effectively wagering their entire $50 million wallet balance on bitcoin’s downside. That short briefly netted Wynn about $3 million in profit before closing, marking one of the largest trades ever executed fully on-chain. Wynn announced stepping back from perpetual trading after securing a cumulative profit of $25 million, earned from an initial investment of just over $3 million. The trader’s latest high-leverage PEPE position has already gained $500,000 amid a nearly 6% rise in the memecoin's value. Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, purchased an additional 4,020 BTC between May 19 and May 25 for roughly $427 million, bringing its total holdings to 580,250 BTC,CoinDesk previously reported. The acquisition was funded through three separate at-the-market equity programs, including sales of common and preferred stock totaling approximately $427 million. These latest bitcoin purchases were executed at an average price of $106,237 per coin, pushing Strategy’s total investment in bitcoin to over $40.6 billion, at an average cost basis of $69,979 per coin. The acquisitions reflect the company’s ongoing commitment to expanding its sizable bitcoin holdings through regular capital raises and share issuances.  “AI Boost” indicates a generative text tool, typically an AI chatbot, contributed to the article.

259,The '$300K Bitcoin Lottery' Grows Even Bigger as Traders Chase Upside – Time to Step Back?,"Earlier this month,CoinDeskhighlighted the rising demand for the Deribit-listed $300,000 bitcoinBTC$109,832.00call option, noting it as one of the most popular bullish plays for the all-important June quarter expiry. Now, this bet has become the most popular in the impending quarterly expiry, reinforcing its appeal as a ""lottery ticket""for traders anticipating a bitcoin price rally above $300,000 by the end of the next month. At press time, the $300,000 call option was the most popular bet in the June 27 expiry, with a notional open interest of over $600 million, up from $484 million three weeks ago, according to data source Deribit. Notional open interest represents the dollar value of the number of active or open contracts at a given time. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC. ""The June $300K BTC call options have emerged as the strike with the highest open interest [in June expiry], reflecting aggressive speculative positioning by traders anticipating continued upside,"" Deribit's Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen told CoinDesk. ""The combination of record-breaking volumes and concentrated options bets signals elevated market confidence—and the potential for heightened volatility ahead,"" Chen added. Deribit's notional optionsopen interest hit a record highof $42.5 billion last week. The momentum is mirrored in the platform’s newly launched block RFQ (Request for Quote) system, registering a historic record of nearly $1 billion in daily volume. A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset, BTC, at a predefined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market. The $300,000 call expiring on June 27 represents a bet that bitcoin's price will rise three times from the present $110,000 to over $300,000 by the end of the first half. The bet sounds outlandish, as the first half will end in roughly four weeks. But that's been the case lately on Deribit, with traders increasingly targeting upside potential through short-term options. That is evidenced by front-end risk reversals, measuring the demand for calls relative to puts over short-term, being pricier than those with longer maturities. The chart by Amberdata shows risk reversals are positive across the board, indicating a bias for bullish call options. However, short-duration calls are pricer than longer-duration ones. Usually, the opposite is the case. The trend indicates a heightened appetite for quick-paced bullish bets among market participants. ""The three-day Bitcoin Conference 2025 is all set to start in Las Vegas today, and so people are speculating on what new bullish announcements will be released at the event,"" Chen explained. The growing demand for short-duration calls could be a contrarian signal suggesting that speculative excess is often seen near market tops, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research. Thielen said the options market is flashing a warning, with the seven-day calls trading at a 10% premium to puts. ""The options market is flashing a warning: Bitcoin’s skew, measuring the difference in implied volatility between puts and calls, has dropped to nearly -10%, indicating calls are pricing in significantly more volatility than puts,"" Thielen said in a note to clients. ""This suggests traders are aggressively chasing upside rather than hedging downside risk. In our experience, such extreme skew levels often reflect peak bullish sentiment, a classic contrarian signal,"" Thielen added.

261,Blockchain.com to Expand Across Africa as Crypto Regulation Begins to Take Shape,"Blockchain.com, a cryptocurrency exchange and wallet provider, is expanding into parts of Africa where crypto regulation is beginning to solidify. The company is focusing on Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa, and plans to open a physical office in Nigeria this quarter, citing it as its fastest-growing market in West Africa,Bloomberg reports. Nigeria recently passed a new investment and securities law, which includes provisions for licensing and regulating cryptocurrency exchanges. “Nigeria has taken meaningful steps toward creating a clear framework for crypto,” said Owenize Odia, Blockchain.com’s general manager for Africa. “Applying for a crypto-exchange license in Nigeria is a top priority.” Other countries are also laying the groundwork. The Bank of Ghana released draftguidelines last year. Kenya, meanwhile, is still in the research phase to further understand the asset class. The move comes after earlier this yearBlockchain.comtook a new step towards a potential initial public offering (IPO)through new executive appointments.

262,Bitcoin Faces Risk of Pullback to $100K as Momentum Indicator Diverges Bearishly: Technical Analysis,"This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Bitcoin'sBTC$109,832.00bull run has stalled, with emerging technical signals pointing to a possible price pullback. The leading cryptocurrency by market value traded near $108,000 at press time, probing the bullish trendline, characterizing the sharp rise from $75K to record highs over $110K, TradingView data show. There has been little bullish action in the past 24 hours despitereports thatthe Trump family media company plans to raise $3b billion to buy cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. A key momentum indicator called the 30-day rate of change (ROC), which measures the percentage increase or decrease in bitcoin's price over the past month, has chalked out a ""bearish divergence."" The bearish pattern happens when an asset's price rises, but momentum indicators like the 30-day rate of change (ROC) fail to confirm the same, hinting at potential weakness and price correction. Although bitcoin remains within a bullish upward channel, the 30-day ROC is forming lower highs, signaling a bearish divergence and weakening momentum. Additionally, the daily chart moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, an indicator widely used to gauge trend strength and changes, has flipped negative, indicating a bearish shift in momentum. All this means that BTC could dive out of the bullish ascending channel, potentially revisiting the major psychological resistance-turned-support at $100,000. The broader outlook remains constructive, consistent with the recent golden cross of the 50- and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs).

263,Bitcoin Rally Stalls Below $110K as Short-Term Holders Take $11B Profits,"After softly rising over the weekend, bitcoinBTC$109,832.00slipped back to $109,000 on Monday in sluggish trading as traditional U.S. markets remained closed in observance of Memorial Day. The top cryptocurrency is still up 1.7% in the last 24 hours and only a breath away from the all-time high it notched last week. Looking at the CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 digital coins by market capitalization, except for stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — the day’s big winner is decentralized exchange UniswapUNI$6.69, which saw its token rise 6.6%. Tokens for ChainlinkLINK$15.96and AvalancheAVAX$23.68also gained 3.3% and 3.4% respectively. The gains happened overnight, spurred by the Trump administration's temporary walkback on EU tariffs. Trump said on Sunday that the implementation of 50% tariffs on EU goods — which on Friday he’d called to go into effect on June 1 and caused a sell-off in risk assets including cryptocurrencies — would be delayed until July 9. European stocks, initially shaken by the threat, rebounded on the news. While the crypto market retraced some of the losses in the weekend tumble, BTC has likely entered a choppy phase as traders digest the rapid, almost 50% run from the April lows, Bitfinex analysts said in aMonday report. Increased profit-taking by short-term holders could also cap bitcoin's near-term upside: this investor cohort realized $11.4 billion in cumulative profits over the past 30 days, compared to $1.2 billion in the previous 30-day period, the report noted. ""At these levels, the risk emerges that profit-taking outpaces new demand inflows,"" Bitfinex analysts wrote. ""Unless thereʼs a corresponding rise in new capital entering the market to absorb this supply, prices may begin to stall or even retrace. ""The next few days will be key to gauge whether the dip to $106,000 has set the range lows or a bigger reset is in the cards, the report said. If a deeper pullback materializes, the key level to watch is the short-term holder cost basis around $95,000, the average price this group bought the asset, the authors noted. Strong inflows to U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs — totaling $5.3 billion in May so far —, low volatility and lack of froth suggest that bitcoin will likely resume its uptrend into the third quarter of the year after a pause, the analysts argued.

A key component of the deal includes a $5.7 million BTC-denominated bond subscribed by Moonlight Capital, issued at a 30% premium over the May 23 closing price ($4.3/share). The company also finalized the exercise of all rights for Convertible Bonds B-02 (""OCA Tranche 2"") initially reserved for strategic investors Fulgur Ventures and UTXO Management at $0.79/share, totaling $66 million. Notably, investor Adam Back has converted all his OCA Tranche 1 bonds into 14.88 million shares, reinforcing long-term alignment with the company’s vision.

267,"OPEC+ members could hike July oil production by 411,000 barrels per day: Sources","Eight OPEC+ members have been rapidly unwinding a set of voluntary production cuts in recent months.These output trims were implemented separately from the broader OPEC+ group's production policy.The eight nations include OPEC+ heavyweights Russia and Saudi Arabia, alongside Algeria, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Eight oil-producing nations of the OPEC+ alliance could hike output by as much as 411,000 barrels per day in July, two OPEC+ delegates told CNBC, continuing a rapid unwinding of voluntary production cuts.Markets are awaiting a final decision on July production, with the eight countries — heavyweight producers Russia and Saudi Arabia, alongside Algeria, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates — set to review market conditions and iron out their output steps on May 31.These nations have been carrying out two sets of voluntary production cuts.One, totaling 1.66 million barrels per day, is in effect until the end of next year. Under the other, the countries trimmed their production by an additional 2.2 million barrels per day until the end of the first quarter. They have since agreed to gradually increase output by a combined 1 million barrels per day over April-June, including 411,000 barrel-per-day hikes in each of this and next month.The OPEC+ delegates, who commented anonymously given the sensitivity of discussions, told CNBC that a further increase of as much as 411,000 barrels per day in July could be agreed this weekend.Market attention has increasingly shifted away from the official unanimous quotas of OPEC+ — which the groupleft unchangedon Thursday — to the unwinding of the eight members' voluntary trims. Crude demand typically picks up during the summer, given higher consumption of jet fuel and gasoline for seasonal travel, along with increases in crude burn to produce electricity for air conditioning in several Middle Eastern countries.This could lend support to oil prices which have struggled amid broader market uncertainty triggered by U.S. tariffs.Ice Brent futures with July expiry were trading at $65.31 per barrel at 12:44 p.m. London time, up 0.63% from the Thursday close price.

269,Acts of kindness can make you happier and healthier: 3 simple ways to give,"Among the many points for assessing happiness around the world,like sharing meals with others and family bonds, researchers for the 2025World Happiness Reportlooked closely at acts of kindness.They discovered that the rate ofbenevolent actswas 10% higher in 2024 than between 2017 and 2019 almost everywhere in the world. They also found that the rate of helping strangers, specifically, is 18% higher than between 2017 and 2019.""People consistently and universally underestimate the kindness of others,"" saysJan-Emmanuel De Neve, editor of the report and director of theWellbeing ResearchCentre at the University of Oxford. But the truth is, it happens more often than people realize.""In the United States, only 30% of people think the wallet will be returned when lost,"" says De Neve. ""The reality is about 60% of wallets get returned when lost."" And these acts improveeveryone's wellbeing. Kindness is a ""dynamic and a virtuous cycle,"" says De Neve, ""in the sense that if you're being virtuous and helping others and being kind to others, that obviously helps the receiving party, but it also helps you.""Researchers now have proof that three different kinds of giving can have this effect:VolunteeringDonating moneyHelping strangers""These things are very strongly correlated with improving one's own life satisfaction, one's own well-being,"" says De Neve. Even toddlers as young as two years old feel pleasure from giving to others, according to the report.In fact, just seeing someone else's generosity has a positive impact on wellbeing, researchers found. And if you're looking to implement these kind acts in your own life, there's virtually no limit to how frequently you should do so in terms of reaping the benefits. ""The kinder you can be without hurting yourself, of course,"" says De Neve, the better.For managers looking for feel-good teambuilding activities, ""allow company employees and teams to volunteer together for their chosen charities on company days,"" suggests De Neve.The wellbeing effects will be the same as those outside of the workplace.Want to be smarter, richer and more confident?Take one (or more!) ofSmarter by CNBC Make It's expert-led online classes, which aim to teach you the critical skills you need to succeed that aren't taught in school.

270,What is the internet of bodies?,"The following is a transcript of the video.You've heard the term ""Internet of Things"" – where inanimate objects can be connected to the internet and each other.But in 2016, academic and author Dr. Andrea M. Matwyshyn took it one step further, coining the term, ""Internet of Bodies,"" or IoB.She describes it as ""a network of human bodies whose integrity and functionality rely at least in part on the Internet and related technologies, such as artificial intelligence.""That might sound far-fetched, but if you have one of these, then you're already part of the IoB world.There are three categories of IoB, based on the device's level of integration.The first generation is external. Things like smartwatches or rings, which use sensors to track our steps and heart rate. Or smart glasses, which function as cameras, headphones and monitors.The second generation is internal. These are devices you ingest or have implanted. Think of pacemakers with digital implants, smart prosthetics hardwired into patients' nerves and muscles... or even digital pills that transmit medical data after being ingested.Finally, there's the third generation. These devices completely merge with the body while maintaining a real-time connection to an external machine and the internet.One of the most notable companies in this space is Elon Musk's Neuralink, which is developing a brain-computer interface, or BCI called ""the Link.""The coin-sized chip is implanted under the skull, where it can read a person's brain signals and allow them to control an external machine.Neuralink's first test subject, who was paralyzed from the shoulders down, used the device to play chess on his laptop. Although a few weeks after the procedure, Neuralink reported some malfunctioning.Proponents of IoB devices say the benefits are clear: they'll improve body cognition and function, improve healthcare, and allow for significant cost savings for people and corporations. But where some see benefits, others see risks. Even the original article coining the term warned against the technology's flaws.For one, data protection will be paramount. Many of these devices will be able to track, record and store personal information. Critics argue that if governments and companies got their hands on this data, they could use it to spy on citizens or turn them into revenue streams. There are also concerns around dependency, addiction and personal safety. Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, for example, admitted that he had his heart implant's wireless function disabled in 2007 over fears that assassins could use it to cause a fatal heart attack.There are also ethical questions to consider. Could we see a world in which the rich are augmented, and the poor aren't? And philosophically, will IoB challenge our notions of human autonomy and self-governance? Who is responsible for monitoring the risks?Most IoB implantable and ingestible devices are regulated by agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. or its counterparts internationally.They have a set of rules for things like cochlear implants or body-part replacements, but IoB consumer devices are not under their purview. The recent emergence of these devices, their fast boom in sales and their varying capabilities somewhat explains the current patchwork of legislation at regional, state and international levels. However, there are some existing laws that could be extended to safeguard IoB data.The EU's General Data Protection Regulation – or GDPR – is designed to protect EU residents from the dangers of data breaches and cyber-attacks.And in the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act – commonly known as HIPAA – is meant to prevent a patient's information from being disclosed without consent.As an industry, there's a lot to play for. According to Mordor Intelligence, the global connected medical device market alone will be worth around 66 billion dollars in 2024 and is expected to reach more than 132 billion by 2029. That's an annual growth rate of nearly 15%.",,https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/31/what-is-the-internet-of-bodies.html,2025-05-30
271,How 'mistakes' helped Hailey Bieber turn Rhode into a $1 billion skincare brand,"Less than three years after its launch, Hailey Bieber's skincare brand Rhode is beingacquired for $1 billion.It's a massive windfall for the 28-year-old founder, and one that she says was only possible because of her willingness to make mistakes while building her business. Indeed, Bieber explained in a 2022 appearance at theForbes Under 30summit that she started Rhode with the understanding that things wouldn't always go smoothly.""Be prepared for the mishaps and be prepared to make mistakes,"" she said.

It will help you to drive your brand forward.""In the case of Rhode, one early problem arose when Bieber was choosing the color of the packaging of her products.

272,What chip shortage? 10 questions with Temasek-backed AI startup unfazed by U.S.-China tensions,"Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET After a stint in data science at Meta and neural studies at Caltech, Jerry Ye said that at the behest of an investor, he returned to China in 2017 with the aim of starting a global company in AI.Last week, his startup Whale announced it raised $60 million in a series C funding round that included Bosch Ventures.""For China, we don't see any shortage in AI computing power,"" Ye said. This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Each week, we'll explore the biggest business stories in China, give a lowdown on market moves and help you set up for the week ahead. Like what you see? You can subscribehere. Hearing about artificial intelligence from Chinese businesses paints a very different picture of how the tech can be applied than is commonly understood.After a stint as a data scientist at Meta, Caltech alumnus Jerry Ye returned to China in 2017 at the behest of an investor, with the goal of starting a global AI company.The startup, Whale, sells AI software tools and related hardware to help retailers. It now claims clients such as Starbucks, Xiaomi and Unilever. Last week, Whale announced that it had raised $60 million in a Series C funding round that included Bosch Ventures, Singtel and MDI Ventures. The startup counts Hangzhou as its China headquarters and Singapore as its global base.I caught up with Ye in Beijing this week as he passed through the city, where he has a small team. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.What's the impact of the U.S.-China trade war?We still think there's a global opportunity even if there are U.S.-China tensions. Business is business. Our customers are global: Procter & Gamble, Watsons, Starbucks.Who will win the AI race?The largest two markets are still the U.S. and China. The application layer will take off in both, in different ways: marketing and sales in China; very, very small vertical sectors in the U.S., such as in transportation or legal. Southeast Asia is more likely to adopt scenarios from the U.S. or China markets.What's restricting AI development? Advanced semiconductors?For China, we don't see any shortage in AI computing power. All the cloud [companies] have a lot of training power. A lot of AI companies don't actually train [models] a lot anymore.Ultimately, on-device chips [often associated with edge computing, or processors built into devices like smartphones, home appliances, etc] are becoming powerful enough to run AI models and can ensure data privacy. In the long run, most of the competition will happen on the edge, instead of at data centers.Where will AI make money for businesses first?Marketing and sales, because they are very close to the money, and the return on investment is easier to calculate. If you adopt AI in marketing and sales over seven days, on the eighth day, you will see results.What does that mean for the future of content?The basic concept of marketing is communication, narrowing the gap between the customer understanding the product and the brand selling the product.We talk a lot about personalization. But traditionally, we didn't have sufficient content, sufficient power to give each person personalized content. With AI's richer understanding and algorithms to bridge the content and the customer, the decision-making is faster and easier.Generative AI definitely gives us a lot of opportunities to generate a huge amount of videos.AI also enables us to send unique slices of live-shot photos and videos to social media. This has become the way ads are increasingly produced.But if you use a lot of generative AI, they convey a lot of fake information. Most platforms are mostly anti-generative AI videos. My personal opinion is that real-life videos are still needed. It's very hard for generative AI to [convey] real emotions, real human touch.How are companies using AI today?Our company services Starbucks in China and Southeast Asia.Each time you purchase a Starbucks coffee, huge amounts of AI are used to make the customer experience better. Right now, consumers can get their coffee order within 5 minutes, 98% of the time. If one location is too busy to handle online orders on top of in-store orders, AI analysis may send those online orders to a different location nearby.How much money is Whale making? What are your costs?Over the last three years, we have grown by about 100% [a year], and for the next two to three years, we will maintain 100% annual growth. We made revenue of 230 million yuan ($31.39 million) last year, and expect 400 million yuan in revenue this year. We have around 500 enterprise customers.We spend about 1 million yuan a month in China on operating costs — outside China, it's more expensive, so the total is around 3 million yuan a month [36 million yuan a year].Our biggest challenge is complying with local data privacy and security needs in every region.Which AI large language model is best?Different models have different capabilities. For Claude, they are really good at generating websites, PDFs. Gemini, video. It's like having PhDs in different domains. For most of our business customers, they don't want to be fixed into one model.A lot of businesses want to keep their data private. That's why they use open-source models, deployed in their own data centers.Is there potential for an AI device,such as glasses?The biggest challenge for most hardware is the battery, not the AI itself.Most of the hardware has been here for a long time.Maybe a new cellphone. The most important thing is the application. The application will take over the large margin of the AI. Cloud has 5% to 10% of the margin, then hardware. There's a huge software layer [of which AI applications] can take 90% to 95% of the margins.What do you think about former Apple designerJony Ive's deal with OpenAI?It will be hard. There's a camera on it. It's good to have large companies trying different AI. They have more potential to try different things. Theodore Shou, CEO of Yiyi Capital, discusses the recent strong performance of the IPO market in Hong Kong and says that the valuation premium between mainland China and Hong Kong stocks would narrow if more Chinese companies list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Ramón Barúa Costa, CEO and director of Aclara Resources, discusses global demand for rare earths, China's dominance in critical minerals, and the strategic importance of rare earths in the energy transition. Lihan Zhou, CEO and Co-Founder of Mirxes, a Singapore-based biotech company, discusses the company's Hong Kong IPO and growth prospects. The U.S. and China are talking.Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau had a call last week, and both sides agreed to keep lines of communication open, according toreadouts on Friday. While no specifics were announced, the call was the first since the U.S. and China agreed this month to pause most tariff increases.China's industrial profits rose in April.Official figures out Tuesday showed profits climbed3% year on yearin April at major industrial companies, faster than the 2.6% recorded in March and growing despite U.S. tariffs. But margins at electric car companies are facing more pressure afterBYD this month announced a slew of discounts.Xiaomi targets Tesla and Apple at the same time.The Chinese smartphone company on Thursdayrevealed a new chipthat it claims beats Apple's on certain metrics — and comes inside a phone far cheaper than the iPhone 16 Pro.

276,Airport expansion race in Asia heats up with Changi's T5,"Changi's Terminal 5 will increase the airport's annual capacity from the current 90 million to 140 million passengers.Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said the decision to build Terminal 5 was because air travel is on a rising trajectory, and ""the bulk of the growth will take place here in the Asia-Pacific region.""The move follows expansion projects completed in other Asian countries, such as South Korea, Thailand and Hong Kong. Asia is set to see a travel boom, and countries in the region are gearing up to exploit this surge in demand.Singapore's Changi Airport on Wednesday broke ground on its fifth terminal, which is expected to be operational in the mid-2030s.The new terminal, which sits on a plot of land 1,080 hectares large, will almost double the size of Changi Airport's existing area.This will allow the airport to handle 140 million passengers per year from its current capacity of 90 million passengers. Changi, which was most recently awarded Skytrax's ""World's Best Airport"" in 2025 for the 13th time, welcomed 67.7 million passengers in 2024.Airports that can handle more than 100 million passengers annually are classified as mega airports, and three out of the 10 existing ones are in Asia, according to airport industry body Airport Council International. These are in Beijing, Tokyo and Shanghai.ACI projects that air travel will grow nearly 7% over the next 25 years. To cope with the demand, airports in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions are poised to undergo extensive development, with combined investments of $240 billion for upgrading existing facilities and building new airports between 2025 and 2035.Speaking at the groundbreaking event, Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said the decision to build Terminal 5 was because ""over the longer term, air travel is on a rising trajectory, and the bulk of the growth will take place here in the Asia-Pacific region.""Wong also said that with Terminal 5, Changi will aim to connect with 200 cities, up from the current 170 city links it has now.""[Changi] has connected our small island nation to the world, and brought the world to Singapore. And this connectivity has powered our growth as an air hub, driving industries like tourism, aerospace and logistics,"" Wong said, pointing out that the aviation ecosystem now contributes 5% of Singapore's GDP. Competition in the region is also intensifying, Wong noted. For example, airports in Asia are investing significantly in modernizing their infrastructure and adjacent facilities like entertainment and retail spaces.Hong Kong International Airport commissioned a third runway in November and is expanding the airport's Terminal 2.The airport's goal, it said,is to serve 120 million passengers and handle 10 million tonnes of cargo annually from 2035.Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport openeda third runway inSeptember 2024, boosting the airport's capacity to handle more flights, following the completion of anew satellite terminala year earlier.Thailand's airport operator alsorevealed a further""East Expansion"" plan to increase the airport's capacity by 2027.In South Korea,Seoul's Incheon International Airportcompleted its ""Phase 4 expansion"" in December, allowing it to handle an annual passenger capacity of up to 106 million from 77 million, and making it the world's third-largest airport.Thomas Pellegrin, Transportation, Hospitality and Services Sector Leader from Deloitte Southeast Asia, told CNBC that Asia has become the ""barycenter"" of air travel growth after the Covid-19 pandemic.This growth in air travel is due to the expansion of the middle class, whose propensity to fly increases faster than income growth, as well as the high urbanization rate in the region, which connects people to air transport infrastructure, he noted.""The regional increase in passenger demand is now forecast at 7.9% in the near term and 5.1% in the long term, which is the highest worldwide and well above mature markets,"" Pellegrin added.This means that Asian airports will need to accommodate roughly twice as many passengers and aircraft by 2043, creating tremendous pressure on the existing infrastructure, he said. Terminal 5 will also feed into Singapore's plan toincrease tourism revenue in the city-statefrom a record-breaking $29.8 billion in 2024 to $47 billion-$50 billion in the next 15 years.Its ""Tourism 2040"" strategy centers on increasing demand from two distinct groups — business and stopover travelers, Grace Fu, Singapore's minister for sustainability and the environment, said in April.In particular, officials aim to triple tourism revenue from business travelers attending meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions, Fu said.According to Singapore Tourism Board CEO Melissa Ow, transit and transfer passengers currently make up a third of Changi Airport's overall traffic.Terminal 5, as well as the broader Changi East development — which also includes a third runway and an industrial zone — will allow Singapore to retain and grow its market share as an air hub, increase connectivity and solidify Changi's standing as the best airport in the world, Deloitte's Pellegrin said.""All these effects combine to give Singapore outsized 'soft power' internationally.""",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/airport-expansion-race-in-asia-heats-up-with-singapores-changi-t5.html,2025-05-30

278,Trump tariffs reinstated by appeals court for now,"A federal appeals court granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily pause a lower-court ruling that struck down most of President Donald Trump's tariffs.The administration had told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that it might seek ""emergency relief"" from the Supreme Court.Trump officials including Peter Navarro and Stephen Miller heaped criticism on the trade court judges following their ruling. A federalappeals courton Thursday granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily pause a lower-court ruling thatstruck downmost of PresidentDonald Trump'stariffs.The Trump administration had earlier told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that it would seek ""emergency relief"" from the Supreme Court as soon as Friday if the tariff ruling was not quickly put on pause.The judgment issued Wednesday night by the U.S. Court of International Trade is ""temporarily stayed until further notice while this court considers the motions papers,"" the appeals courtsaid in its order.The pause gives the Trump administration some breathing room as it prepares to argue that the trade court's ruling should be halted for the duration of the appeals process.Trump officials maintain that they have other options for imposing tariffs, even if they do not prevail in the case.""Even if we lose, we will do it another way,"" Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro told reporters at the White House on Thursday afternoon.The appeals court gave the plaintiffs — a group that includes state attorneys general and a handful of domestic businesses — one week to respond to the administration's bid for a stay pending appeal. The U.S. will be able to reply to that response by June 9.""This is merely a procedural step as the court considers the government's request for a longer stay pending appeal,"" said Jeffrey Schwab, a lawyer for the business plaintiffs, in a statement.""We are confident the Federal Circuit will ultimately deny the government's motion shortly thereafter, recognizing the irreparable harm these tariffs inflict on our clients,"" Schwab said.The three-judge trade court panel — which included a Trump appointee — had invalidated all of Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs and other duties.The judges found that the 1970s-era law Trump had invoked to enact those tariffs, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, does not ""confer such unbounded authority"" to presidents.The nationwide, permanent block they imposed covered all of the retaliatory tariffs that Trump issued in early April as part of his sweeping ""liberation day"" plan to reshape international trade with the rest of the world.The ruling also barred the administration from making any future modifications to the tariffs in question. The court gave the administration10 daysto make the necessary changes to carry out the orders.The government filed a notice of appeal shortly after the judgment came down. It asked the trade court to pause any enforcement of its ruling while the appeal process played out, while also seeking ""at least interim relief"" from the federal appellate court.At the same time, the Trump administration aimed a barrage of criticism at the trade-court judges, accusing them of bias and abusing their power.""The Supreme Court must put an end to this,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday afternoon. ""These judges are threatening to undermine the credibility of the United States on the world stage.""""We are living under a judicial tyranny,"" White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller wroteThursday morningin response to the ruling, escalating his initialclaimthat ""the judicial coup is out of control.""",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/blocked-trump-tariffs-trade-court-appeal.html,2025-05-30

This was the basis of Trump's tariffs on China during his first term.""As the administration can impose an across-the-board tariff and country-specific tariffs under other legal authorities (e.g., Sec. 122 and Sec. 301) this ruling represents a setback for the administration's tariff plans and increases uncertainty but might not change the final outcome for most major US trading partners,"" said Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius in a note to clients.""As it seems unlikely that the administration could win an appeal in the 10 days it has under the CIT order to remove the tariffs, we would expect the White House to announce a similar across-the-board tariff using Sec. 122,"" Hatzius added.Section 122 of the same Act allows the White House to impose import tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days on nations that have ""large and serious"" trade surpluses with the U.S.Goldman's economist also suggested that while the White House is likely to find ways to reimpose tariffs, it's unlikely to be able to do it forall the nations targeted in the so-called ""Liberation Day"" announcement.""This would then provide the administration time to launch a series of Sec. 301 cases against larger trading partners, potentially opening the door to imposing tariffs higher than 10% in some cases.

""Chair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook.""Moreover, the release indicated that Powell and his central bank colleagues remain committed to setting monetary policy on ""careful, objective, and non-political analysis.""The meeting comes at a sensitive time for the U.S. economy, with Trump pushing potentially inflationary tariffs and the Fed trying to balance its mandate to provide full employment and stable prices.""The president did say that he believes the Fed chair is making a mistake by not lowering interest rates, which is putting us at an economic disadvantage to China and other countries and the president's been very vocal about that, both publicly and now I can reveal privately as well,"" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked about the meeting at her daily briefing.Using his Truth Social media outlet, Trump repeatedly has called for the Powell-led Federal Open Market Committee to lower interest rates. The FOMC hasn't eased since December, just before Trump took office for his second nonconsecutive term.""THE CONSENSUS OF ALMOST EVERYBODY IS THAT, ""THE FED SHOULD CUT RATES SOONER, RATHER THAN LATER.""

""I wouldn't do that. There's never a reason for me to ask for a meeting.

288,Gap shares fall as retailer says tariffs could cost $100 million to $150 million,"Gap delivered another strong earnings beat, but President Donald Trump's trade war is weighing on its turnaround.Tariffs could cost the company between $250 million and $300 million, it said, but with mitigation efforts it expects the cost to be between $100 million and $150 million.CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC it plans to diversify its supply chain and reduce its exposure to China and that it isn't planning for ""meaningful"" price increases. New tariffs could impactGap's business by $100 million to $150 million, if theyremain in effect, the company said Thursday when announcing fiscal first-quarter earnings.Shares fell more than 15% in after-hours trading.In a news release, Gap said new30% dutieson imports from China and a 10% levy on imports from most other countries will cost the company between $250 million and $300 million without mitigation efforts. For now, it's leaving that impact out of its guidance.Gap said it's already mitigated about half of those costs and without further action, the cost is expected to be between $100 million and $150 million, which will likely show up on the balance sheet in the back half of the year. The company said it's going to build on its mitigation efforts by continuing to diversify its supply chain and reducing its exposure to China.CEO Richard Dickson said on a conference call with investors Thursday that the company is planning to buy more cotton from the U.S. to help mitigate the tariff impact.""Based on what we know today, we do not expect there to be meaningful price increases or impact to our consumer,"" Dickson told CNBC in an interview. ""I've talked about this often: We truly believe that strong brands can win in any market. It's a big industry. It's a big market. Obviously we're a big player with market share, but as we look ahead, we see the potential to further market our brands and gain share.""Beyond tariffs, Gap issued fiscal first-quarter results that beat expectations on the top and bottom lines.Here's how the apparel company performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share:51 cents vs. 45 cents expectedRevenue:$3.46 billion vs. $3.42 billion expectedThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 3 was $193 million, or 51 cents per share, compared with $158 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier.Sales rose to $3.46 billion, up about 2% from $3.39 billion a year earlier.Gap's guidance was largely in line with consensus, but its gross margin forecast came in weaker than expected. It's expecting full-year sales to grow between 1% and 2%, in line with LSEG expectations of 1.3% growth.For the current quarter, it said it expects sales to be flat, compared with LSEG expectations of 0.2% growth. It's expecting its gross margin to be 41.8%, weaker than the 42.5% that StreetAccount had expected. That expected impact to gross margin isn't related to tariff effects, but rather the company lapping certain benefits it saw in the year-ago period related to its credit card program.In March, before PresidentDonald Trumpissued new tariffs on imports from most parts of the world, the company was expecting a minimal impact from the duties. But three months later, it's in a different position.In March, Gap said it sources less than 10% of its products from China, but it now expects the country to represent less than 3% of its sourcing by the end of the year. The Trump administration imposed a new 30% tariff on imports from China.Its two largest trading partners are Vietnam and Indonesia, where Gap manufactured 27% and 19% of its products in fiscal 2024, respectively, according to its most recent annual filing.Vietnamis facing a potential 46% reciprocal tariff and, if that duty remains in effect, it could have a significant impact on Gap's income.Trump's trade war and the duties that are currently in effect are throwing a wrench into Dickson's plans to turn around the legacy retailer — efforts that are well underway and continuing to bear fruit.During the quarter, comparable sales grew 2%, the company said, essentially in line with StreetAccount expectations of 1.8%. Gross margin and operating margin also came in higher than expected.Here's a closer look at each Gap brand's performance.Old Navy:Gap's largest and most important brand notched sales of $2 billion, up 3% compared with last year, the company said. Comparable sales grew 3%, it said, ahead of StreetAccount expectations of 2.1%. Denim and active led the brand's growth, which was buoyed by marketing designed to get all of Gap's brands back at the center of culture. Old Navy's new campaign ""Old Navy. New Moves"" features celebrities including Lindsay Lohan and Dylan Efron.Gap: The company's namesake banner saw sales of $724 million, up 5% compared to last year. Comparable sales were up 5%, ahead of expectations of 3.4%. Dickson has focused much of his turnaround efforts on the Gap brand, and it's been a standout performer over the last couple of quarters. Gap brand's growth was fueled by ""style, product newness, innovation and compelling marketing,"" Dickson said. ""Gap is speaking for itself, and people are speaking about Gap.""Banana Republic:The safari chic brand is still seeing troubles, with sales down 3% to $428 million and comparable sales flat, compared with expectations of 1.5% growth. The company said it remains focused on improving the brand. Dickson said he's ""encouraged"" by the progress Banana is making — such as its splashy collaboration with HBO's hit show ""The White Lotus"" — but there's still more work to be done to win back the customer's trust.Athleta:The athleisure brand has also been a drag on Gap's overall performance, with sales down 6% to $308 million and comparable sales down 8%. The figures were not comparable to consensus estimates. The company warned improvements at Athleta ""will take time."" Dickson said the brand has made strides in improving profitability but it needs to fix product and marketing to get Athleta back to growth. The company said previously it's still working through inventory that was geared more toward trend-forward customers and didn't land as well with Athleta's base. ""While we've been successful in bringing new customers into the brand, we just still did not have enough compelling products to appeal to our large existing base, and that's showing up in the performance,"" Dickson said.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/gap-earnings-q1-2025.html,2025-05-30
289,Trump could ask Supreme Court to halt tariff block as soon as Friday,"The Trump administration said it may ask the U.S. Supreme Court as soon as Friday to immediately pause a ruling blocking many of President Donald Trump's tariffs.Trump's aides are lashing out at the federal trade-court judges who just struck down many of the president's tariffs.The Trump administration asked the court to pause enforcement of their ruling while the case is on appeal.The order blocks tariffs that Trump invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.Even if the ruling stands, Trump may have other ways of imposing import taxes without approval from Congress. The Trump administration said it may ask the U.S.Supreme Courtas soon as Friday to immediately pause a federal courtrulingblocking many of PresidentDonald Trump's tariffs.The U.S. will seek the ""emergency relief"" from the nation's highest court ""to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake,"" it said in afilingin the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Thursday morning.But the government said it will only take that step if the federal appeals court does not quickly issue at least a temporary pause of the tariff ruling.""The Supreme Court must put an end to this,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday afternoon in a blistering attack on the three judges who struck down Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs and other duties.The judges ""brazenly abused their judicial power to usurp the authority of President Trump to stop him from carrying out the mandate that the American people gave him,"" Leavitt claimed in a press briefing.""These judges are threatening to undermine the credibility of the United States on the world stage,"" she added.Her comments were the Trump administration's latest salvo against the panel on the U.S. Court of International Trade, whose ruling Wednesday night dealt a major blow to the president's trade agenda.As it seeks relief from the higher courts, the Trump administration is also asking that the trade-court judgespauseany enforcement of theirrulingwhile the case is being appealed.Later Thursday, a federal judge in a separate case in Washington, D.C., alsodeclaredthat many of Trump's tariffs are unlawful.""We are living under a judicial tyranny,"" White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller wroteThursday morningin response to the ruling, escalating his initialclaimthat ""the judicial coup is out of control.""Top trade advisor Peter Navarro accused the court of being ""globalist"" and ""pro-importer"" on Bloomberg TV Thursday, and claimed it was biased against the administration's tariff policies.""We have these unelected judges who are trying to force their own will when it comes to tax policy, trade policy and all matters of the economy,"" Trump advisor Jason Miller said during a Fox Business interview Thursday morning.Those three judges — Jane Restani, Timothy Reif and Gary Katzmann — were appointed to the federal bench by two Republicans, Presidents Ronald Reagan and Trump, and one Democrat, Barack Obama, respectively.The Trump administration in Thursday's court filing slammed the judicial panel's ruling, saying it ""rests on a dangerously flawed interpretation of the President's tariff authority.""The trade court also ""erred in second-guessing the President's judgment that these tariffs are needed to address the national emergencies he declared,"" the government said.Wednesday's ruling invalidated dozens of country-specific tariffs that Trump imposed earlier this year under the purported authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.The judges found that the law does not ""confer such unbounded authority"" to presidents.The nationwide, permanent block they imposed covers all of the retaliatory tariffs that Trump issued in early April as part of his sweeping ""liberation day"" plan to reshape international trade with the rest of the world.The ruling also bars the administration from making any future modifications to the tariffs in question. The court gave the administration10 daysto make the necessary changes to carry out the orders.The Trump administration filed a notice of appeal shortly after the judgment came down.

More recently, he has leaned heavily on the promise of tariffs to generate federal revenue as he seeks to cut taxes and increase military spending.In the meantime, however,Trump has other meansof imposing import taxes unilaterally.Goldman Sachs economists pointed to three relatively obscure parts of U.S. trade law that could come into play soon: Sections 122 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, and Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930.Navarro projected optimism about the administration's choices on Thursday.""Any trade lawyer knows there's just a number of different options we can take,"" he said.

291,Here's how many fake reviews Tripadvisor found on its website in 2024,"Around 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted to Tripadvisor in 2024 were fake, according to the ""Tripadvisor Transparency Report 2025.""That's more than twice the number detected in 2022, company reports show.In addition to taking a stronger policy stance against fake reviews, the company's detection system is getting stronger, a company vice president told CNBC Travel. Around 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted to Tripadvisor in 2024 were fake, according to the company's ""Transparency Report 2025.""That's more than twice the number detected in 2022, according to company reports.But that doesn't mean the number of fake reviews on the site doubled, said Becky Foley, vice president and head of trust and safety at Tripadvisor.While submissions to the website increased, Tripadvisor's policies on fake reviews also changed, she said, citing the company's more aggressive stance against ""incentivized reviews."" These occur when companies offer customers discounts or freebies in exchange for reviews, or provide incentives to employees whose names are mentioned in reviews. ""The employees get their mom, best friend or cousin to submit reviews, mentioning their names,"" she said. ""It ends up leading to businesses having reviews that aren't actually valuable to our community."" What is a fake review?According to Tripadvisor, it is ""any review submitted by someone who is knowingly submitting biased or non-firsthand content, in an effort to manipulate a property's reputation."" But there's a bigger reason detections are on the rise, she said.""Our system is always getting better,"" she said, citing Tripadvisor's three-pronged process that relies on auto-detection, human review and community feedback.Some 7% of submissions in 2024 were auto-rejected before being posted, the report said. Auto-detections also flagged another 5% of submissions for human review.  However, Tripadvisor's trust and safety team ultimately moderated more than 4.2 million reviews, amounting to more than 13% of all submissions in 2024, according to the report.Another 244,000 reviews were disputed by members at the third stage of review, the report showed. Of these, some 72% remained on the site, and 28% were removed, it said. Tripadvisor has four categories of fake submissions: boosting, vandalism, member fraud and paid reviews, Foley said.  There's a misconception that vandalism accounts for most fake reviews, Foley said, adding that boosting (54%) and member fraud (39%) have long made up the bulk of those reviews.Paid reviews (4.8%) are a smaller but ""more pernicious"" category of fakes, she said.This includes ""review farms,"" she said, adding that these authors are often involved in other types of online fraud too.  Most paid reviews originate in Asia, Foley said, even though only 17% of real submissions came from the continent last year.In 2024, more than one-third of all paid submissions detected by Tripadvisor came from Indonesia and Vietnam, while in 2022 most paid reviews came from India, reports show. Rooting out fake reviews is a constant ""cat and mouse"" game, Foley said. But Tripadvisor is getting better at detecting them every year, she said.""We are the first to admit that we're never going to reach absolute perfection,"" said Foley. ""We might not catch [a fake] the first time, but we'll catch it eventually.""Tripadvisor uses its own technology, developed over 25 years, to flush out fakes — a system that increasingly relies less on what a review says, and more on how it's posted, she said. The company uses artificial intelligence and behavioral biometrics to find patterns, which can detect abnormalities like submission spikes and IP address masking attempts.To catch paid reviewers, Tripadvisor investigators pose as fake review brokers, Foley said. When a bad actor posts their first paid review, ""we have all of the data … hundreds of data points associated with it,"" which the company uses to build patterns to identify other reviews submitted by the author in the past.Violators aren't pulled off the site, but their rankings are penalized for a year, Foley said. Repeat offenders receive a red badge on their listing ""that says this property is trying to deceive you,"" she said. Most reviews written by AI are not fake, Foley said, calling that ""one of the myths I love to bust.""Most are written by regular travelers that use the technology to make their writing more polished, she said.Still, the company doesn't allow them — at least not for now.In 2024, Tripadvisor removed more than 200,000 reviews that it suspected were written by AI, according to the company's 2025 transparency report.""We will continue to monitor the trends and patterns. But right now, we just don't want travelers to come to TripAdvisor for a sea of sameness.""",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/26/heres-how-many-fake-reviews-tripadvisor-found-on-its-website-in-2024-.html,2025-05-30
292,European stocks close lower as enthusiasm fades after judges halt Trump tariffs,"This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets.  7 Hours Ago European stock markets closed lower on Thursday, as investors rode the latest turn in the Trump tariff rollercoaster. Europe'sStoxx 600index ended the session 0.19% lower, with Germany'sDAXdown 0.44%.To recap, on Wednesday evening a federal trade courtstruck down President Donald Trump's""reciprocal tariff"" policy, which slapped hefty universal duties on imports from countries around the world, and ordered the administration to stop collecting them. Global equities initially brightened on the news, thougheconomistsandU.S. officialsalike argue that Trump is likely to find a work-around to the block. Meanwhile, analysts point out that a huge number of uncertainty still hangs over businesses and global trade.""The upside risks to U.S. inflation and downside risks to GDP would be reduced if the Supreme Court also rules against the tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, but it would be unlikely to mark the end of the tariff war given the various other routes through which the Trump administration could impose tariffs,"" economists at Capital Economics said in a note.On Friday, we'll be monitoring preliminary German inflation figures ahead of the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting next week. — Jenni Reid  8 Hours Ago Germany'sDAXwas last down 0.4% on Thursday, but the blue chip index is nonetheless up more than 20% in the year to date, with sectors from banking and industrials to defense boosted by anticipation of afiscal spending boost.Earlier today, Laura Cooper, head of macro credit and global investment strategist at Nuveen, spoke to CNBC's ""Early Europe Edition"" about the drivers of the year's outperformance and why we might see ""more tepid advances"" going forward.

Shares were up more than 5% on Thursday.— Jenni Reid  10 Hours Ago President Donald Trump's negotiating power over tariffs has been weakened even if he eventually finds a way to restore much of his policy, notes Lizzy Galbraith, senior political economist at Aberdeen.""The administration will almost certainly appeal the ruling and seek to lift the block on IEPPA tariffs while the case is ongoing. The case will first go to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit but is likely to end up in the Supreme Court,"" Galbraith said in a note.""Nevertheless, the ruling has significant implications for countries that were in trade negotiations with the U.S. Many are likely to wait for clarity on whether the block on tariffs is maintained before making big concessions. So, the ruling undercuts Trump's negotiating leverage,"" she added. Andrew Thurston, customs duty senior manager at professional services firm MHA, flagged questions arising for businesses resulting from the decision.""While imports surged in the first quarter as businesses looked to avoid tariffs from April, can we expect a similar effect while we wait for the decision of the appeal? Perhaps, but businesses continue to navigate murky waters and will be wary of making wholesale strategic changes in such a turbulent environment,"" Thurston said.""Not only will tariffs at U.S. customs be halted for the foreseeable, but will businesses that have already paid 'illegal' tariffs on U.S. imports be reimbursed? If so, this would be a sizeable task for the U.S. customs authorities and businesses may be left in the dark for a long period of time.""— Jenni Reid  10 Hours Ago Global stock markets have pared some of their initial enthusiasm on the news Wednesday night that the U.S. Court of International Trade has ordered President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariff orders be vacated.Much commentary on Thursday morning hascentered on potential workaroundsthe Trump administration may find to continue with its controversial policy.Europe'sStoxx 600index was 0.2% higher at 1:24 p.m. in London, down from gains of around 0.5% earlier in the session, with the U.K.'sFTSE 100near-flat and Germany'sDAXup just 0.1%.

This was the basis of Trump's tariffs on China during his first term.""As the administration can impose an across-the-board tariff and country-specific tariffs under other legal authorities (e.g., Sec. 122 and Sec. 301) this ruling represents a setback for the administration's tariff plans and increases uncertainty but might not change the final outcome for most major US trading partners,"" said Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius in a note to clients.""As it seems unlikely that the administration could win an appeal in the 10 days it has under the CIT order to remove the tariffs, we would expect the White House to announce a similar across-the-board tariff using Sec. 122,"" Hatzius added.Section 122 of the same Act allows the White House to impose import tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days on nations that have ""large and serious"" trade surpluses with the U.S.Goldman's economist also suggested that while the White House is likely to find ways to reimpose tariffs, it's unlikely to be able to do it forall the nations targeted in the so-called ""Liberation Day"" announcement.""This would then provide the administration time to launch a series of Sec. 301 cases against larger trading partners, potentially opening the door to imposing tariffs higher than 10% in some cases. However, it seems unlikely that the administration could complete Sec. 301 investigations on every US trading partner within the next several months,"" Hatzius added.—Ganesh Rao  15 Hours Ago The U.S. dollar index — which measures the greenback against a basket of major rivals — is up 0.2% after U.S. judgesthrew cold wateron President Donald Trump's tariffs plans.

293,"SEC drops Binance lawsuit, ending one of last remaining crypto enforcement actions","The dismissal by the SEC comes two after the agency accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users and misusing customer funds.The SEC was the last major regulator still pursuing Binance after a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. government last year that saw Zhao plead guilty and step down, while retaining much of his wealth.Binance is taking a $2 billion investment from the Emirati state fund MGX entirely in USD1, a stablecoin newly launched by the Trump family's World Liberty team. The SEC has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, bringing an end to one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions brought by the agency.In a Thursday filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, lawyers for the SEC and Binance jointly moved to dismiss the case, which wasfirst brought in June 2023. The case had accused the crypto exchange of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds.The dismissal marks a symbolic end to one of the most aggressive crypto crackdowns in U.S. history, and comes as the Trump administration makes a concerted effort to prove that it's an ally to the industry. The Justice Department has shut down its crypto enforcement team, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is now set to be led by a venture capitalist with close ties to crypto.Binance is the largest digital assets exchange in the world by volume.

295,Etsy CEO: People who make these 2 early-career moves become more successful than most,"If you want a successful and fulfilling career, stop worrying about what other people think,EtsyCEO Josh Silverman said atPace University's commencement ceremonyon May 19.College graduates are often tempted to choose the same career paths as their friends — but that's a mistake, Silverman said. Instead, early-career professionals should do two simple things to kickstart their careers: Find a job based on skills and interests you already have, and be open to exploring unexpected opportunities that could reroute your path, he said.""For me, the most important thing has always been to start by throwing myself, with zealous passion, into something that I liked enough and I was good enough at,"" said Silverman.Silverman's career took several twists and turns before he became the CEO of Etsy, which has a market cap of $5.51 billion as of Thursday afternoon. He enrolled at Brown University as a theater student, graduated with a degree in public policy — with an emphasis on health care — and got a job answering emails for U.S. Senator Bill Bradley, he said.When he wasn't on the clock, he volunteered to pick up other tasks and formed bonds with co-workers, he added: ""[I] was an absolute sponge in meetings. [I hung] out by the water cooler, determined not to miss the most interesting conversations.""DON'T MISS:How to change careers and be happier at workThree years into that job, Silverman was asked to join a burgeoning consulting practice run by Bradley's chief of staff, he said. Following an interesting opportunity in a brand-new industry introduced Silverman to the private business sector, where he eventually went on to lead companies like Evite, eBay's Shopping.com and Skype before starting his tenure at Etsy in 2017.Focusing on the skills you're building, rather than the next step on any predetermined career ladder, can help you become a more appealing applicant in a rapidly changing job market: More companies are gradually shifting toward ""skills-based hiring,"" which ranks competencies — like time management or critical thinking — over credentials like education, according toa 2023 ZipRecruiter survey.Artificial intelligence could speed up that transition. In the next five years, nearly three-quarters of skills used in most jobs will change because of AI, and bosses will need to prioritize candidates with a mix of AI skills and soft skills like communication and leadership,predicted a LinkedIn report published in January.Pursuing a job in an industry you genuinely enjoy won't automatically make you more productive, creative or successful, Silverman noted. The parts of the job you enjoy the least may eventually become the moments you find most personally fulfilling — or beneficial to your career — in retrospect, he said.""When I look back at what, in hindsight, were the most rewarding periods of my life, they were never fun in the moment,"" he said.

In 2024, global gross domestic product — or GDP — amounted to $109.5 trillion— slightly over a third of that global debt number.Another way to picture it? There are about 8.1 billion of us living in the world today. If we were to divide that debt up by person, each of us would owe about $39,000.So, with global debt at a record high, should you be concerned? And how did we get here in the first place?Global debt combines borrowings from households, businesses and governments.You're probably most familiar with household debt, which includes things like mortgages, credit card and student debt. At the beginning of 2024, this amounted to $59.1 trillion.Business debt, which corporations use to finance their operations and growth, sat at $164.5 trillion, with the financial sector alone making up $70.4 trillion of that amount.Finally, there's government debt, which is used to help fund public services and projects without raising taxes.Countries can borrow from each other or from global institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.But governments can also raise money by selling bonds... which is essentially an IOU from the state to investors. And like all loans, it includes interest.Public debt stood at $91.4 trillion. While debt may have a bad rap, it isn't necessarily a bad thing. It could help an individual get an education or join the property ladder. It enables businesses to start up and scale up. And though national debt is the most contentious of the three, it can give governments the leverage they need to build the economy, for social spending, or respond to a crisis.Written record shows public debt has been around for at least 2,000 years, primarily used to establish towns, cities, states and nations... and to fund wars. Governments have long amassed heavy debts from wartime expenses, such as the Napoleonic Wars, Franco-Prussian War and U.S. Civil War in the 19thcentury.World War II, the most expensive war in history, triggered several debt crises, with most of the outstanding loans being owed to the United States.Since the 1950s, there have been four major waves of debt accumulation.The first debt wave originated from Latin America in the 1980s, which led 16 countries in that region to restructure their borrowings.The second wave impacted Southeast Asia at the turn of the 21stcentury, while the U.S. and Europe took the brunt of the third global debt wave during the 2007–2008 global financial crisis.We are now in the fourth wave, which began in 2010, and coincided with the Covid-19 pandemic. Governments had to take on even more debt to help businesses and its citizens cushion the impact of lockdowns.Global debt rose to 256 percent of GDP in 2020, a 28-percentage point increase - and the biggest one-year debt rise since the Second World War.But the pandemic just exacerbated a problem that was already there. Debt had been piling up for at least a decade before, as individuals, companies and governments spent beyond their means. Just look at this graph from the World Bank, which shows debt as a percentage of GDP, rapidly climbing from 2008.This brings us to a critical question: how much debt is too much debt? When does it become unsustainable?Put simply, it's when you can no longer afford it.So, for example, when a government is forced to make cuts in areas that hurt its people, such as education or healthcare, just to keep up with payments.Take Zambia for instance. In 2021, debt servicing accounted for 39% of its national budget. That year, the government spent more on paying these debts than education, health, water and sanitation combined. And it's completely hampered the nation's ability to invest in its future.Debt-to-GDP ratio is the economic metric that compares a country's government debt to its gross domestic product. It's usually presented as a percentage and is seen as a good indicator of that country's ability to service its debts.So, let's pretend we have two countries, each with $30 billion in debt. Sounds like they have the same problem, right? But if it turns out that one of those countries has a $30 billion economy, and the other has a nearly$30 trillioneconomy, it's clear which country is shouldering the bigger debt burden.This, often coupled with unfavorable foreign exchange and interest rates, is why debt is seen as riskier for smaller economies.But there are, of course, exceptions.Japan, the world's fourth largest economy, is also one of the world's most indebted countries, with total debt sitting above 600% of GDP. And while the bulk of Japan's debt is public, in recent years, it has been the financial sector piling on – not the government.Around two-thirds of the $315 trillion owed originates from mature economieswith Japan and the United States contributing the most to that debt pile. But generally, the debt-to-GDP ratio for mature economies has been coming down.On the other hand, emerging markets held $105 trillion in debt, but the EM debt-to-GDP ratio hit a new high of 257% - pushing the overall ratio up for the first time in three years. China, India and Mexico were the biggest contributors.The fourth wave has been the biggest, fastest and most wide-ranging rise in debt we've seen since World War II. Better policies and financial regulations have kept a far-reaching debt crisis at bay.But with so much money on the line, the prospect of a stronger dollar or a trade war could be enough to tip a country - or several - into default.",,https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/28/how-the-world-got-into-315-trillion-of-debt.html,2025-05-30
297,Trump administration emerges as a staunch defender of Germany's far-right AfD,"President Donald Trump's administration has emerged as a staunch defender of Alternative for Germany, a political party with Nazi echoes that has risen in popularity — and that German intelligence officialsrecently classifiedas a ""proven right-wing extremist organization.""The party is known by its German initialism, AfD, and it has included leaders who have embraced old Nazi slogans and minimized the atrocities of Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust.Vice PresidentJD Vanceand Secretary of StateMarco Rubiohave criticized the German government's efforts to isolate and investigate AfD, arguing that such actions amount to undemocratic persecution of a rival political group.""It's one thing to say that a particular set of views is gross ... or somehow outside the Overton window, outside the bounds of reasonable discourse,"" Vance said in an interview last week in Rome,where he attended Pope Leo XIV's inaugural Mass. ""I think that it is very, very dangerous to use the neutral institutions of state — the military, the police forces ... the intel services — to try to delegitimize another competing political party. I think that's especially true when that political party just got second in an election and is, depending on which poll you believe, either the [most] popular or the second-most popular party.""Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump confidant who has wielded significant White House power, has gone further than Vance and Rubio, havingcampaigned with AfDahead of elections in February, when the partyfinished in second placeand further established its popularity.""Only the AfD can save Germany,""Musk posted on X, his social media site, in December. The Rubio-led State Department reinforced the Trump administration's line Tuesday.In apost on Substack, Samuel Samson, a senior adviser in the department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, wrote that the German government ""has established elaborate systems to monitor and censor online speech under the guise of combating disinformation and preventing offense.""Samson specifically cited the recent decision to label AfD as extremist. He also raised concerns about the treatment of far-right parties and leaders in other European countries, includingMarine Le Pen, whose recent embezzlement conviction in Francecould prevent her from running for presidentin a 2027 race she had been favored to win.""Americans are familiar with these tactics. Indeed, a similar strategy of censorship, demonization, and bureaucratic weaponization was utilized against President Trump and his supporters,"" Samson wrote. ""What this reveals is that the global liberal project is not enabling the flourishing of democracy. Rather, it is trampling democracy, and Western heritage along with it, in the name of a decadent governing class afraid of its own people.""Samson added that ""Europe's democratic backsliding not only impacts European citizens but increasingly affects American security and economic ties, along with the free speech rights of American citizens and companies.""""Our hope,"" he continued, ""is that both Europe and the United States can recommit to our Western heritage, and that European nations will end the weaponization of government against those seeking to defend it.""Vance emphasized similar themes in aspeech in Februaryat the Munich Security Conference, where he chastised German leaders for, among other things, refusing to include AfD in the country's governing coalition despite its electoral gains. While he was in Germany, Vance met with Friedrich Merz, now the chancellor, and withAlice Weidel, a co-chair of the AfD.An AfD spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. The party has long denied the charge that it is an extremist group, andit suedGermany's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution over the intelligence agency's recent classification. A spokesperson for the agency, citing the lawsuit, declined to comment. During last week's interview, Vance emphasized that he has not endorsed AfD or encouraged Germans to support it. He described his and Rubio's advocacy as a matter of democratic principles.Trump's first campaign for president in 2016 fed on chants by his supporters to ""lock her up!"" — a reference to his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, who had not been charged with any crime. More recently, he and his allies accused former President Joe Biden, who beat Trump in his 2020 re-election bid, of weaponizing the Justice Department against Trump and other Republicans.The Trump administrationlaunched an investigationthis month of former FBI Director James Comey, a Trump critic who had shared on social media a photo of seashells arranged to spell out ""8647.""Trump allies interpreted the message as an assassination threat, noting that ""86"" can be a slang term for getting rid of something and that Trump is the 47th president. Trump's director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, hascalled for Comey to be imprisonedover the post. But the number 86 does not always have violent connotations; it's use in the hospitality industry can refer to removing or refusing service to a customer.Read more from NBC News:As colleges halt affinity graduations, students of color plan their own cultural celebrationsA new Covid variant could drive up summer cases: Here's what you should knowMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says she is 'disappointed' that Trump is considering a pardon for men who plotted to kidnap herAsked how his and Rubio's concerns square with such Trump administration actions and rhetoric, Vance argued that there is a ""reasonable"" question about whether Comey had advocated for Trump's assassination.""I'm a pretty big believer in free speech,"" Vance said. ""But I don't think that saying you should kill Donald Trump is an acceptable part of public debate. Everybody's going to draw their line. I think where I draw the line is encouraging violence against political opponents. If there's a determination that Comey encouraged violence against a political opponent, then that's a problem. And if there's a determination that he didn't, then that's a different question.""While Vance has not endorsed AfD, he described apro-AfD pieceMusk wrote in December as ""interesting.""""Also interesting; American media slanders AfD as Nazi-lite,"" Vance wrote in hisJan. 2 social media postthat called attention to Musk's piece. ""But AfD is most popular in the same areas of Germany that were most resistant to the Nazis.""AfD was founded in 2013, its early messaging geared toward anti-European Union voters. In subsequent years, the party became known for its strident anti-immigrant rhetoric. In 2017, anAfD adcriticized as Islamophobic asked: ""Burkas? We prefer bikinis."" Another, featuring the image of a pregnant woman, asked: ""New Germans? We'll make them ourselves.""The party has grown in popularity, coinciding with a rise of right-wing voter sentiment across the United States and Europe. Last year, AfD became the first far-right party towin a state electionin Germany since the Nazis.Meanwhile, links and comparisons between AfD and the Nazis have been inescapable.At an AfD rally in 2017, attendees chanted that they would""build a subway"" to Auschwitzfor their political opponents. A founding AfD member, Alexander Gauland, oncedescribed the Nazi eraas a mere ""speck"" of bird excrement in German history. A party leader, Björne Höcke, has twice been found guilty by a German court of purposefully employing Nazi rhetoric. (He has appealed the rulings.) Another AfD politician, Maximilian Krah,resigned his party leadership postunder pressure and suspended campaign activities last year after he said the SS, the Nazis' main paramilitary force, were ""not all criminals."" When Muskappeared virtuallyat an AfD campaign event in January, he leaned into a talking point consistent with the party's desire to move beyond the guilt over Nazi-era atrocities, lamenting that ""there is too much focus on past guilt."" The same week, Musk faced criticism after he offered a gesture many found similar to a Nazi salute at a Trump rally in Washington.In its designation of AfD as an extremist organization on May 2, the German intelligence agency asserted that the party ""aims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society."" AfD also does not consider German nationals with histories of migration from Muslim countries as equal to German people, the agency added at the time.The report drew aquick rebuke from Rubio, who is also Trump's national security adviser.""Germany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition,""Rubio wroteon X. ""That's not democracy — it's tyranny in disguise.""Vance then piggybacked on Rubio's post with aCold War analogy.""The AfD is the most popular party in Germany, and by far the most representative of East Germany. Now the bureaucrats try to destroy it,"" he wrote. ""The West tore down the Berlin Wall together. And it has been rebuilt — not by the Soviets or the Russians, but by the German establishment.""Vance contended in last week's interview that holding down a rival political party because of its beliefs allows its beliefs to ""take on an almost mystical power"" by removing them from the public dialogue.""I don't like Nazism, and I don't like people who are sympathetic with Nazis,"" Vance said. ""But I think the way to beat back against it is to debate it and defeat it and not believe that you can, kind of, like, bury this thing underground, because you can't.""",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/trump-administration-emerges-as-a-staunch-defender-of-germanys-far-right-afd.html,2025-05-30
298,More than half of the summer's top trending travel destinations are in Asia,"Led by Japan, Asia is home to more than half of this summer's top 15 emerging travel destinations, according to a report from the Mastercard Economics Institute.Tokyo and Osaka topped the list, followed by Shanghai, Seoul, Beijing and Singapore, with Vietnam's Nha Trang and Japan's Fukuoka named 11th and 13th, respectively.The report also found that Asian consumers are more motivated to travel because of foreign currency fluctuations, compared with travelers from other parts of the world. Asia is home to more than half of this summer's top 15 emerging travel destinations, according to a report released Monday by the Mastercard Economics Institute.Tokyo and Osaka topped the list, which compared summer flight bookings for 2024 and 2025 to find the places experiencing the most growth in travelers.The ranking shows continued interest in Tokyo, which ranked No. 2 on last year's list.""Japan's status as a travel powerhouse remains unshaken,"" said David Mann, chief economist for Mastercard, Asia Pacific. ""Tokyo and Osaka remain magnets for global tourism.""Paris is No. 3 on the list, reflectinga drop in travelers during the summer of 2024caused by the Summer Olympic Games, followed by Shanghai at No. 4.Beijing, Seoul and Singapore round out the top 10 list — alongside two cities in Spain, Palma de Mallorca and Madrid, and Brazil's Rio de Janeiro — with two lesser-known spots in Asia, Vietnam's Nha Trang and Japan's Fukuoka named 11th and 13th, respectively.  The report showed that interest in visiting Asian cities is mainly driven by Asian, European and American travelers.Asia also tops the summer trip list for Middle Eastern travelers, though bookings rose the most for trips to Thailand —  not Japan. Tokyo was the most visited city in the world in 2024, as value-seeking travelers were attracted by the depreciatingJapanese yen, which hitits weakest level against the U.S. dollar since 1986last year.The yen's depreciation has partially reversed — the currency reached 147.98 Tuesday relative to the greenback — but it is likely still a significant factor drawing visitors, according to the Mastercard Economics Institute report.""Currency depreciation can influence tourism in many countries, but the scale of response seen in Japan is exceptional,"" said Mann. ""While weaker exchange rates typically make destinations more attractive, Japan's broad appeal ... intensifies the effect.""The report also showed that currency fluctuations matter more to Asian travelers than others. The data showed a 1% depreciation of the yen drove a 1.5% increase in visits from mainland China, compared with a 0.2% increase from the Germany, France and New Zealand.Similarly, a small drop in the U.S. dollar resulted in more visits to the U.S. from Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and India, according to the report.""Travelers from Asia-Pacific are especially attuned to value, and that makes them more responsive to exchange rate shifts,"" said Mann. ""In markets like the Chinese Mainland, Singapore, and South Korea, even a 1% change in currency value can have an outsized impact on travel decisions.""British travelers, however, are largely impervious to currency fluctuations. Their travel patterns remained steady despite currency drops in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Switzerland and the United States, the report showed. The report also noted that economic and political factors have shifted travel preferences well ahead of the summer season.More people are traveling to Saudi Arabia, specifically to Jeddah and Riyadh, spurred by the government's economic diversification efforts and increased investments and business travel to the country, the report noted.However, the United States is experiencing a decline in international visits, most notably among Canadians, it said.A report published on April 23 from JPMorgan stated that foreign travel to the U.S. showed clear signs of weakening. International air arrivals dropped nearly 5% in February, despite expectations that the month would see a growth in foreign visitors, it stated. Read moreInternational students are rethinking U.S. study plans amid visa policy shifts, experts say In 2024, foreign spending in the United States reached $215 billion, or about 0.7% of the country's gross domestic product, according to JPMorgan's estimates. A 10% drop in foreign travelers would therefore have less than 0.1% effect on gross domestic product growth, it said.""Still, a downturn could be felt materially in the tourism sector and educational sectors: foreigners accounted for 6% of tourism demand in 2023, and over 10% for hotels and restaurants, and they also make up 6% of higher education enrollment.""In this scenario, weakness in the U.S. dollar could draw more to visit, according to the JPMorgan report.That may be especially true among Asian tourists, who accounted for 40% of foreign travel spending in the United States in 2023, it said.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/top-summer-travel-destinations-more-than-half-are-in-asia.html,2025-05-30

""Chair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook.""Moreover, the release indicated that Powell and his central bank colleagues remain committed to setting monetary policy on ""careful, objective, and non-political analysis.""The meeting comes at a sensitive time for the U.S. economy, with Trump pushing potentially inflationary tariffs and the Fed trying to balance its mandate to provide full employment and stable prices.""The president did say that he believes the Fed chair is making a mistake by not lowering interest rates, which is putting us at an economic disadvantage to China and other countries and the president's been very vocal about that, both publicly and now I can reveal privately as well,"" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked about the meeting at her daily briefing.Using his Truth Social media outlet, Trump repeatedly has called for the Powell-led Federal Open Market Committee to lower interest rates. The FOMC hasn't eased since December, just before Trump took office for his second nonconsecutive term.""THE CONSENSUS OF ALMOST EVERYBODY IS THAT, ""THE FED SHOULD CUT RATES SOONER, RATHER THAN LATER."" Too Late Powell, a man legendary for being Too Late, will probably blow it again - But who knows???""Trump postedon May 17.This was the first meeting since Trump began his second term. At a news conference earlier this month, Powell confirmed that the two had not met yet, and said he wouldn't be making the first move for a presidential sit-down.""I've never asked for a meeting with any president, and I never will,"" Powell said. ""I wouldn't do that. There's never a reason for me to ask for a meeting. It's always been the other way.""With tariff uncertainty lingering, markets largely expect the Fed to stay put on rates until there's more clarity. Futures market pricing indicates the central bank won't resume cutting until at least September, bypassing meetings in June and July, with a likelihood of another reduction before the end of the year. The FOMC lowered rates by a full percentage point in the latter part of 2024.The full Fed statement:At the President's invitation, Chair Powell met with the President today at the White House to discuss economic developments including for growth, employment, and inflation.Chair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook.Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the FOMC will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.

303,3 key takeaways from Nvidia earnings,"Nvidia said it missed out on $2.5 billion in sales during the April quarter thanks to the China export restrictions on H20.Companies like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Amazon Web Services still make up about half of its data center revenue.CEO Jensen Huang cited a ""sharp jump in inference demand,"" which the company's Blackwell chips are designed for. Nvidiareported strong fiscal first-quarterearningson Wednesday.Wall Street was pleased with Nvidia's continued sales growth, which hit 69% during the quarter. The company's data center division continues to surge as companies, countries and cloud providers snap up Nvidia graphics processing units, orGPUs, forartificial intelligencesoftware.""The team continues to maintain a 1- 2 step lead ahead of competitors with its silicon/hardware/software platforms and a strong ecosystem, and the team is further distancing itself with its aggressive cadence of new product launches and more product segmentation over time,"" wrote JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur.Here are three big takeaways from the company'searnings: Nvidia expects to sell about $45 billion in chips during the July quarter, it revealed on Wednesday, but that's missing about $8 billion in sales that the company would have recorded if not for the U.S. restricting exports of its H20 chip without a license.Nvidia also said it missed out on $2.5 billion in sales during the April quarter thanks to the export restrictions on H20.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on the company's earnings call thatChinarepresented a $50 billion market that had effectively been closed to Nvidia.He also said that the export controls were misguided, and would merely encourage Chinese AI developers to use homegrown chips, instead of making an American platform the world's choice for AI software.""The U.S. has based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips. That assumption was always questionable, and now it's clearly wrong,"" Huang said.He said that export controls were driving AI talent to use chips from homegrown Chinese rivals, such as Huawei.""We want every developer in the world to prefer the Americantechnology stacks,"" Huang told CNBC'sJim Crameron Wednesday night.Nvidia said it didn't have a replacement chip for China ready, but that it was considering options for ""interesting products"" that could be sold in the market.Strength in the company's Blackwell business balanced out some concerns over the China impact.""NVIDIA is putting digestion fears fully to rest, showing acceleration of the business other than the China headwinds around growth drivers that seem durable. Everything should get better from here,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore. Nvidia says that it has many customers ranging from sovereign nations to universities to enterprises that want to research AI.But it confirmed again on Wednesday that cloud providers — companies likeMicrosoftAzure,GoogleCloud,OracleCloud Infrastructure andAmazonWeb Services — still make up about half of its data center revenue, which reported $39.1 billion in sales during the quarter.These companies tend to buy the fastest and latest Nvidia chips, including Blackwell, which comprised 70% of Nvidia's data center sales during the quarter, CFO Colette Kress said on the earnings call.Microsoft, for example, had already deployed ""tens of thousands"" of Blackwell GPUs, the company said, processing ""100 trillion tokens"" in the first quarter. Tokens are a measure of AI output.And it'll be first in line to get Blackwell Ultra, an updated version of the chip with additional memory and performance. Nvidia said shipments of those systems will start during the current quarter.Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon said the ""general outlook and environment overall seems very encouraging"" as the company ramps up its Blackwell rollout and compute requirements grow.""Amid a messy quarter, NVIDIA is comporting themselves extremely well,"" he said. For the past few years, many Nvidia GPUs were used for a resource-intensive process called training, where data is processed through an AI model until it gains new abilities.Now, Huang is talking up the potential for Nvidia's GPUs to serve the AI models to millions of customers, a process called inference in the industry. He said on the earnings call that is where new surging demand is coming from.""Overall, we believe NVDA's technology leadership remains strong, with growth in Blackwell shipments benefitting from exponential growth in reasoning AI and the achievement of economies of scale,"" said Deutsche Bank's Ross Seymore.Huang says that the latest AI models need to generate more tokens — or create more output — in order to do ""reasoning,"" which improves AI answers. Of course, Nvidia's latest Blackwell chips are designed for this, Huang said.""We are witnessing a sharp jump in inference demand,"" Huang said. ""OpenAI, Microsoft and Google are seeing a step-function leap in token generation.""Huang compared modern AI models to the ""one-shot"" approach that ChatGPT used when it first debuted in 2022, and said that the new models need ""a hundred, a thousand times more"" computing.""It's essentially thinking to itself, breaking down a problem step by step,"" Huang said. ""It might be planning multiple paths to an answer. It could be using tools, reading PDFs, reading web pages, watching videos and then producing a result."" Huang struck a notably more somber tone during the call, focusing heavily on the impact of export controls rather than his usual evangelizing about AI's world-changing potential.He spoke at length on the call about U.S. chip restrictions and clearly stated how much of an impact the limits have on current and future business.""The AI race is not just about chips,"" he said. ""It's about which stack the world runs on. As that stack grows to include 6G and quantum, U.S. global infrastructure leadership is at stake.""—CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos contributed to this article.Correction: Stacy Rasgon is an analyst at Bernstein.

304,Millennial entrepreneur raised $2 million for a money-saving app for immigrants,"One millennial entrepreneur raised $2 million to build a financial app catered to traditional money-saving methods used by immigrant communities in the West.Silicon Valley native Nina Mohanty founded Bloom Money in 2021, a fintech app designed to support U.K.-based immigrant communities to save money collaboratively, also known as ""money circles"" or rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCA). The 32-year-old founder has raised £1.5 million ($2 million) in venture capital to build Bloom Money.Mohanty, who has lived in the U.K. for a decade and worked at banks like Starling Bank, Klarna and Mastercard, says mainstream banks don't understand how immigrant communities manage their money.""At a certain point I just realized I got very frustrated wondering who was building for immigrant communities because I was building the same product for the same person all the time,"" Mohanty said in an interview withCNBC Make It.Mohanty pointed out that when it comes to money, much of the innovation for immigrant communities is focused on remittance as many transfer money to families in their home countries. ""I kept scratching my head and wondering, why is all the innovation about sending money away and not actually about pooling resources and building wealth here?"" Immigrants tend to save money differently — rather than relying on mainstream options like high-interest savings accounts or taking loans from a bank, they rely on community and collaboration.""I wouldspeak to bus drivers on their cigarette breaks or aunties that are cleaning offices and ask them how they were managing their money and I kept coming across this thing where people were pooling funds together,"" she explained.This informal pooling system involves a group of people who commit to saving money together. For example, three friends agree to each pay $100 a month into a savings pot, making a total of $300. The first month, one friend gets access to the full $300, which can be spent on a plane ticket home, new shoes for the kids, or even on investing in a business, among other things. The next month, the second friend gets to use the $300.The rotation continues until each person gets the opportunity to spend the $300. The group can agree to continue the cycle for as long as they need.""It's academically called a roster or a rotating savings and credit association [ROSCA], but it's very community-led. It's very socially led,"" Mohanty said, adding that a number of ethnic groups have a name for the practice.For example, it's known as a chit fund by Indians; ""pardner"" by Jamaicans; ""kameti"" by Pakistanis; ""ajo"" or ""esusu"" by Nigerians; and ""hagbad"" by Somalis.Mohanty pointed out that immigrant communities often faced discrimination within the financial system.""In this country [U.K.], Jamaicans, for example, used to do this. When the Windrush generation first came over, because the banks wouldn't lend to them, they would effectively build this microcredit within their own communities.""Ethnic minorities in the U.K. still report facing discrimination. A2023 reportby the non-profit organization Fair4All Finance — which included a survey of 1,005 U.K. adults from ethnic minority groups and 1,182 white, British adults — found that one in five people from minority ethnic groups said they experienced racial discrimination when dealing with financial providers.On top of that, 28% say they think that the way things work at financial organizations means ethnic minorities are more likely to be treated unfairly. Although rotating savings have served as an informal but reliable system within immigrant communities, Mohanty highlighted various issues, such as a lack of regulation, especially when dealing with cash in hand.""There's a clear gap here and we have the tech to be able to do this digitally,"" Mohanty explained.A few apps have emerged internationally to cater to this traditional savings method, including Egyptian money circles app Moneyfellows and Hakbah, an alternative financial savings app based in Saudi Arabia.Bloom Money caters specifically to immigrant communities in the U.K. ""who are straddling providing for two households"" the company said. Users can create a circle and invite others to participate in that circle. ""That whole account is for the benefit of everyone that's in the group,"" Mohanty said. ""You're less likely to have a situation with someone taking the money and running home.""And though it's possible to manage a rotating money savings system via mainstream banks, the behavior was often flagged as ""suspicious"" when she worked at Monzo, Mohanty said.""They were looking at this and going 'What is this? This looks like money laundering.' And so they would actually start shutting down accounts. If you don't know what the behavior is, it's going to look suspicious, but for us, we literally built the product around this behavior.""Rotating savings ""doesn't fit into the Western construct,"" Mohanty said, adding that the creation of Bloom Money is a ""fight for a more diverse formal financial system."" Bloom has aims that go beyond digitalizing the rotation of savings. It wants to build investment products, as many immigrants are so focused on sending money home that it comes at the expense of wealth planning for future generations.""They're not necessarily planning for their future or their next generation so imagine if our parents hadn't saved or hadn't put money into their pension pots or investment clubs and so we want to now make it so that people can build their wealth,"" Mohanty said.The Fair4All Finance report showed that compared with white, British people, ethnic minorities were less likely to have savings or investment accounts, and workplace pensions.""Some experts highlighted that characteristics of minority ethnic groups can mean they are more likely to have 'thin files' with little credit history, so difficult to make a credit judgement to produce a credible credit score,"" the report said.""Positive behaviours such as regular remittances or taking part in informal savings circles do not contribute [to credit profiles] and we even found fears these could count against people.""Now Bloom Money is building users' credit profiles to lend money to them to help them invest in their pension pots or gold and ""build financial services that are fit for diaspora who are straddling countries.""Mohanty said the company hopes to ""make it as easy as clicking a button to say 'You've received your payout from your Bloom circle. Why don't you invest it into your pension?'""Correction: This article has been updated to reflect the banks where Mohanty has worked, and to clarify the definition of a ROSCA.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/millennial-raised-2-million-for-money-saving-app-for-immigrants-.html,2025-05-30

306,Jim Cramer says this is the easiest way for the market to get out of its tariff 'nightmare',"Monday - Friday, 6:00 - 7:00 PM ET CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday weighed in on the legal battle surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs.The ""Mad Money"" host said the added uncertainty could give way to a positive outcome for the market. CNBC'sJim Cramersaid Thursday the court fight over PresidentDonald Trump's tariffs temporarily injects more uncertainty into the stock market — but, he argued, it ultimately could be a gift to investors who worry about the effects of the White House's trade policy.""Even if you believe in fair trade, not free trade, as I do, you have to wonder how we're going to get any meaningful deals now that our trading partners know the courts might invalidate the whole tariff agenda,"" Cramer said on""Mad Money.""""In that sense, but only in that sense, maybe the judiciary shooting down the tariffs is the easiest way out of this nightmare.""Cramer's comments came after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both ended Thursday'ssession up 0.4%, well off their highs of the session. Early trading action on Thursday morning suggested Wall Street was headed for a strong day, thanks to artificial intelligence bellwetherNvidia'sbetter-than-expectedearnings reportthe prior evening and a ruling from the U.S. Court of International Trade thatstruck downmost of Trump's tariffs.However, the positive sentiment fizzled as the day went on, Cramer contended, because uncertainty over the legal challenges to the tariffs increased. The Trump administration vowed to fight that lower-court ruling, and saidit could ask theSupreme Court to pause the decisionas soon as Friday. Then, on Thursday afternoon, an appeals court ruled in favor of the White House and temporarily paused the Court of International Trade's ruling.""Right now, the administration has to hope that our trading partners believe the Supreme Court will uphold the tariffs, or that another lawsuit against the next iteration of tariffs will somehow fail. Because if the judiciary shoots down the tariffs, Trump has zero cards to negotiate new trade deals,"" Cramer said.The reason why that matters for the stock market is hope that the U.S. would soon strike trade deals with many countries — leading to lower import duties and more clarity for businesses and consumers alike — has helped fuel the S&P 500's rally in recent weeks. The index is up nearly 19% from its April 8 close, the day before Trump voluntarily paused most of the ""reciprocal"" tariffs that drove the market into a four-day plunge.""Then again, if the [Supreme Court justices] do side against the White House, we don't need to worry about retailers raising prices across the board to pass on the tariff pain,"" Cramer said.When asked to respond to Cramer's remarks, the White House pointed CNBC to comments made earlier Thursday by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. ""The Supreme Court must put an end to this,"" Leavitt said at a press briefing. The judges sitting on the U.S. Court of International Trade ""are threatening to undermine the credibility of the United States on the world stage,"" Leavitt also said.Disclosure: Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust, the portfolio used by the CNBC Investing Club, owns a position in Nvidia.

Chinese startup DeepSeek, which caused shockwaves across markets this year, quietly released an upgraded version of its artificial intelligence reasoning model.The company did not make an official announcement, but the upgrade of DeepSeek R1 was released on AI model repository Hugging Face.DeepSeek rose to prominence this year after its free, open-sourceR1 reasoning model outperformed offeringsfrom rivals including Meta and OpenAI. The low-cost and short time of development shocked global markets, sparking concerns that U.S. tech giants were overspending on infrastructure and wiping billions of dollars of value of major U.S. tech stocks like AI stalwart Nvidia. These companies have since broadly recovered.Just as was the case with DeepSeek R1's debut, the upgraded model was also released with little fanfare. It is a reasoning model, which means the AI can execute more complicated tasks through a step-by-step logical thought process.The upgraded DeepSeek R1 model is just behind OpenAI's o4-mini and o3 reasoning models on LiveCodeBench, a site that benchmarks models against different metrics.""DeepSeek's latest upgrade is sharper on reasoning, stronger on math and code, and closing in on top-tier models like Gemini and O3,"" Adina Yakefu, AI researcher at Hugging Face, told CNBC.The upgraded model has ""major improvements in inference and hallucination reduction,"" Yakefu said, adding that ""this version shows DeepSeek is not just catching up, it's competing."" Hallucination refers to AI that provides incorrect information.DeepSeek has become the poster child of how Chinese artificial intelligence is still developing despite U.S. attempts to restrict the country's access to chips and other technology. This month, Chinese technology giantsBaiduandTencentrevealed how they weremaking their AI models more efficientto deal with U.S. semiconductor export curbs.

309,CRISPR-based gene editing revolutionized medicine—what's next?,"CRISPR-Cas 9 is a gene-editing tool that made it possible to rewrite any organism's genetic code and tackle genetic diseases more effectively.Known as genetic scissors, CRISPR identifies a DNA sequence that is cut by an enzyme called Cas 9. It then changes or replaces that sequence with a different section of DNA.For this discovery, co-inventors Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020.""By our interest in the lab to find new molecules that could have a role in in thebacterium streptococcus pardonus, we came across a very neat mechanism that allows to really recognize the virus that infects the bacterium in a very, very specific minor at the level of the genome of the virus. And we exploited this natural mechanism to develop the CRISPR-Cas9 technology,"" Emmanuelle Charpentier said in an interview with CNBC'sThe Edge.In 2013, Charpentier co-founded CRISPR Therapeutics to fulfil her lifelong goal of finding cures for diseases.A decade later, the company and its partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals developed CASGEVY, a therapy to treat blood disorders beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease.""With CASGEVY, we're taking the bone marrow cells from the patient, making the edit for that particular patient and we're putting it back into the patient, and it reconstitutes the hematopoietic system of the patient. We're making a drug just for you,"" CRISPR Therapeutics' CEO Samarth Kulkarni toldThe Edge.CASGEVY is a one-time therapy that costs $2.2 million per patient and can be administrated on patients 12 years of age and older.

312,The 10 U.S. cities where retirees live on the highest annual incomes,"In Carlsbad, California, retirees live on an average income of $85,442 a year fromSocial Security paymentsand withdrawals from savings and investments — the highest amount of any of the 344 largest U.S. cities, according to arecent SmartAsset analysisof Census Bureau data.These two sources generally make up the majority of retirees' income. In fact, 58% of retirees say Social Security is a major source of their income,according to a 2024 Gallup poll. In 2025, eligible Americans will receive an average of just under $24,000 a year in retirement benefits,according to the Social Security Administration.But because Social Security retirement benefits are partially tied to earnings,higher earners tend to get bigger checkswhen they start claiming,though there is a cap. The same group is also likely to save more for retirement during their working years, which is why the cities where retirement income is the highest also tend to have the largest average Social Security benefits.In just 19 of the cities SmartAsset analyzed, Social Security checks make up more than half of retirees' total income, and those places are home to some of the lowest-earning retirees overall. In the 10 highest-earning cities, Social Security makes up roughly 30% to 40% of retirees' total income.Further, Social Security payments don't seem to vary as widely as retirement account withdrawals, per SmartAsset's findings.

Carrollton, TexasAverage income from retirement accounts:$54,319Average Social Security income:$23,602Total:$77,921Theamount you'll receive from Social Securityin retirement varies based on a number of factors, including how many years you worked, how much you contributed to Social Security taxes, your birth year and the age you start claiming benefits.Your benefits may be reduced if you start collecting earlier than your full retirement age, which is 67 for Americans born in 1960 and later.You have more control over the amount you're able to withdraw from tax-deferred retirement accounts like 401(k)s, although there are still some restrictions. You can start withdrawing money at age 59½, but once you turn 73, you generally must take out a set amount each year, known asrequired minimum distributions. Theamount of money you'll needeach year in retirement can vary widely based on your location, if you plan to work at all and what kind of lifestyle you want.A comfortable life — meaning your essential bills are covered and you have some extra funds for leisure or unexpected costs — could run you as little as $61,000 a year in Mississippi or over $129,000 a year in Hawaii, according to2024 estimates from GOBankingRates.A general rule of thumb for retirement planning is toaim to live on 4% of your savingsyour first year in retirement, then adjust that amount for inflation going forward. The idea is that making withdrawals of around 4% each year will allow you to live off your savings for roughly 30 years.For reference, a retiree in Carlsbad would need over $1.4 million invested to be able to take out $56,685 in their first year following the 4% rule.But you may need more or less, depending on the lifestyle you want. When deciding the total amount of savings to aim for, take into account factors such as where you plan live, how long you expect to be retired and how you plan to spend your time.Want to boost your confidence, income and career success?Take one (or more!) ofSmarter by CNBC Make It's expert-led online courses,which aim to teach you the critical skills you need to succeed that you didn't learn in school.

313,China’s EV price war is heating up. What’s behind the big discounts?,"Industry giant BYD announced a slew of discounts — some of nearly 30% or more – on selected models.The average car price has fallen by around 19% over the past two years in China to around 165,000 yuan ($22,900).Rather than reflecting market expansion, double-digit growth of new energy vehicles sales in China is just eating into internal combustion engine cars' slice of the pie, Ying Wang, Fitch managing director, APAC Corporate ratings, told reporters Tuesday. BEIJING — Competition in China's electric car market just got fiercer with consequences for the domestic economy and even the global auto market.Industry giantBYDlast week announceda slew of discounts— some of nearly 30% or more — across severalof its lower-end battery-only and hybrid models. The budget-friendly Seagull compact car saw its price drop to 55,800 yuan ($7,750).Other major Chinese automakers have begun following suit.""BYD's action this time has made the industry rather nervous,"" Zhong Shi, an analyst with the China Automobile Dealers Association, said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.""The industry is in [a state of] relatively large shock,"" he said, noting smaller automakers are now more worried about their ability to compete.The industry has been a rare bright spot in an economy that has been seeing slower growth and lackluster consumer demand. Part of Beijing's latest attempt to spur consumption included subsidies for new energy vehicles, a category that includes battery-only and hybrid-powered cars.""The latest car price competition underscores how supply-demand imbalance continues to fuel deflation,"" Morgan Stanley's Chief China Economist Robin Xing said in a report Wednesday.""There is growing rhetoric about the need for rebalancing [to more consumption], but recent developments suggest the old supply-driven model remains intact,"" he said. ""Thus, reflation is likely to remain elusive."" China's electric car market has already been in a price war for the last two years,partly fueledbyTesla.But this time, traditional automakers, including state-owned ones, are feeling significant heat as the share of new energy vehicles has come to account for abouthalf of new passenger carssold in China.Last week, Great Wall Motors Chairman Wei Jianjunwarned of an ""Evergrande""in China's auto industry that had yet to explode, comparing the fast-growing EV industry to the country's bloated real estate sector. The outspoken private sector autos executive was speaking to Chinese media outlet Sina in an interview posted on May 23.Once China's real estate giant,Evergrande defaulted on its debt in late 2021as the property market slumped after Beijing cracked down on the company's high debt levels. Demand for homes also fell following tighter government regulations, leaving the developer struggling to finance the remaining construction of pre-sold units.As Chinese media scrutiny on automakers' financial situation rose, BYD on Wednesday refuted reports that it excessively pressured one of its dealers on cash flow. The dealer, Jinan Qiansheng in the eastern province of Shandong, did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. BYD referred CNBC to its statement to Chinese media.In the early years ofChina's state-supportedefforts tobecome a global leaderin the emerging electric vehicle industry, the Ministry of Finance said it found at least five companiescheated the government of over 1 billion yuan($140 million). The high-level policy encouraged a flood of startups, of which only a handful survived. In China, the average car retail price has fallen by around 19% over the past two years to around 165,000 yuan ($22,900), according to a Nomura report this week, citing industry data from Autohome Research Institute.Price cuts were far steeper for hybrid or range-extension vehicles, at 27% over the last two years, while battery-only cars saw prices slashed by 21%, the report said. It noted that traditional fuel-powered cars saw a below-average 18% price cut.In contrast, the average price of a new car in the U.S. was$48,699 in April, upnearly 1% from two years earlier,according to CNBC calculations of data from Cox Automotive. The average electric car price last month was an even higher $59,255.BYD's latest round of price cuts didn'tinclude the company's higher-end models priced around 200,000 yuan, such as its flagship Han electric sedan.Reuters pointed out the newest model of the Han released in February wasabout 10% cheaper than its previous version, according to its calculations.The Chinese auto giant, which was backed by Warren Buffett in its early years, has rapidly captured market share in China with its wide range of cars at various price points. Thecompany reporteda net profit increase of 49% to 14.17 billion yuan last year. Total current liabilities rose by more than 60% to 57.15 billion yuan. Cash and cash equivalents fell slightly to 102.26 billion yuan. Rather than reflecting market expansion, double-digit growth of new energy vehicles sales in China is just eating into internal combustion engine cars' slice of the pie, Ying Wang, Fitch managing director, APAC Corporate ratings, told reporters Tuesday. She noted how the country's auto market hasn't grown much since 2018, and expects autos retail sales to only increase by low single digits this year.Automakers will keep on using price cuts to gain market share in China this year, she said. Wang pointed out another option is for companies to include more features, such as advanced driver-assist systems, for free instead of asking consumers to pay more for them as an add-on.Geely-backed Zeekr in March said it wasreleasing its advanced driver-assist system for free, while Tesla has attempted to charge its customers for a similar feature. A month earlier, BYD announced it was rolling out driver-assist capabilities to more than 20of its carmodels. In the last several months, China's top leaders have increasingly called for efforts to address non-productive business competition, known as ""involution."" The term was mentioned in the premier's annual work report in March and in the market regulator's meeting last week which called for ""comprehensivelyrectifying 'involutionary' competition.""However, the massive effort to produce lower-cost electric cars in China, and the automakers' subsequent move to expand into other markets, has increased worries about the impact on other countries' auto industries.TheEuropean Union slapped tariffs on imports of China-made electric carsafter probing the companies over the use of government subsidies in their manufacture.The U.S. alsoimposed duties of 100% on China-made electric cars, quashing hopes that the vehicles might enter the world's second-largest auto market.But in the EU, tariffs have had limited effect. In April,BYD outsold Tesla in Europefor the first time, according to JATO Dynamics. Tesla's Europe salesplunged by 49% that month, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.— CNBC's Bernice Ooi contributed to this report",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/chinas-ev-price-war-heats-up-whats-behind-the-big-discounts.html,2025-05-30

The top reason people give for wanting to move out of the U.S. is for adventure, enrichment and growth, according to the survey. Some 56% of respondents say the U.S. is too conservative, while 53% feel the country is too divided. Roughly half of the expat-curious say they want to move for more or different freedoms, and to avoid the threat of gun violence; 41% say they hope to save money while living abroad.Two-thirds of Expatsi's test-takers say they want to leave the U.S. by 2026, with 12% saying they hope to move in the next six months.

316,The most common travel scams in 9 global cities,"The travel industry is one of the sectors most susceptible to fraud, with scams rising 18% during the summer peak season and 28% in the winter peak season in 2024, according to a report from the Mastercard Economics Institute.Many travel-related fraud complaints involve travel agencies and tour companies, it said.But common scams vary by city, with taxi and car rental problems comprising the majority of reported cases in cities like Bangkok, Thailand and Jakarta, Indonesia, the report showed. The travel industry is one of the sectors most susceptible to fraud, with scams rising 18% during the summer peak season and 28% in the winter peak season in 2024, according to a new report.The report, published last Tuesday by the Mastercard Economics Institute, showed that fraud related to travel agency and tour company bookings is more than four times higher than the fraud average of other industries.""Once paid, the tour may either never occur or be drastically different from what was promised,"" it said.However, scam risks vary significantly from city to city, said David Mann, chief economist at the Asia-Pacific division of the Mastercard Economics Institute. ""In certain destinations, you can end up seeing a lot more of the fraud coming from the travel and the tour company side. In other cities, it can even be in things like food services. So a good example, over in Los Angeles, [food is] the biggest portion of where we see some of the fraud,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Friday.  According to Mastercard's data, tourists reported the lowest rates of fraud in San Francisco, U.S.; Dublin, Ireland; Seoul, South Korea; Budapest, Hungary; and Edinburgh, Scotland.However, travelers to other cities reported higher levels of fraud: Cancun, Mexico; Hanoi, Vietnam; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Bangkok, Thailand.The type of scams commonly reported in cities also varies, with taxi and car rental problems comprising just 2% of reported fraud cases in Hong Kong and Barcelona, but 66% in Jakarta, Indonesia, the report showed.  Fraud in food services is more prominent in the U.S. and Middle East, comprising 63% of reported cases in New York City, it showed. That includes restaurants that overcharge for food, add unauthorized tips, or that steal travelers' credit card details, according to a Mastercard representative. Beyond peak seasons, travel fraud is also on the rise during the booking stage, Mann said.Trip planning fraud rose more than 12% last year, the report stated, be it via doctored photographs, malicious ""confirmation"" links that expose banking details, or other forms of trickery.Travelers should watch out for unusually low prices and summer rates that are ""too good to be true,"" especially in popular tourist destinations that attract large crowds, the report stated.To protect themselves against fraudulent activity, travelers can set up digital wallets, buy travel insurance or book trips using a credit card with fraud protection, it said.Correction: This article has been updated to accurately reflect Budapest's location.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/19/the-most-common-travel-scams-in-9-global-cities-.html,2025-05-30

Subrahmanyam, CEO of India's state-run think tank Niti Aayog said, ""we are the fourth-largest economy as I speak ... and this is not my data. This is IMF [international monetary fund] data.""""India today is larger than Japan,"" Subrahmanyam said, adding that the nation will go on to displace Germany as the third-largest economy, just behind the U.S. and China in around three years.  IMF data, however, projectsIndia's economy to reach $4.187 trillion in 2025, marginally surpassing Japan's $4.186 trillion. So while not already there, the country is very much on the path to becoming the fourth-largest economic powerhouse, preceded by Germany, China and the U.S.Keeping the trajectory in focus, and putting aside the merits of the claim, what is it that's working for the country — and what is holding it back? ""Long-term structural dynamic,"" driven by India's huge demographic and growing educated youth population, isenhancing India's capabilitiesin technology and services, while also paving itsambitions to become a manufacturing hub, said Malcolm Dorson, senior portfolio manager at Global X ETFs — one of the largest foreign asset owners in India.Dorson also sees ""tactical tailwinds"" from lower oil and higher gold prices, given India imports around 80% of its energy needs, while roughly 20% of the nation's household savings in physical gold.Collectively, these factors make India a ""fine-tuned compounding machine,"" he said, adding that the country gaining a spot in the top four by GDP ranking ""is a done deal.""Dhiraj Nim, foreign exchange strategist and economist at ANZ Bank agrees:It should not be surprising if India becomes the world's fourth-largest economy around mid to end this year, aided byimproving domestic consumptionas demand in rural clusters improves.Consumption constitutesover 56% of India's economy— making it the top growth engine. Rural areas accounted for nearly 40% of overall consumer goods sales in the first quarter of 2025,data from market research firm NielsenIQ shows.A sizable number of India's rural population is farmers, so Nim expects a pickup in their spending in the upcoming quarters with better weather conditions facilitating higher crop yields and in turn stronger income and purchasing power, with falling inflation also supporting consumption.He also expects urban consumption to grow, albeit at a slower pace, following tax cuts and stimulus doled out in the budget earlier this year, with more rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India offering an added boost.The benefits of India's economic growth will translate into increased capital flows, as foreign investors would want to capitalize on it, Dorson said.""This could lead to higher valuations, which inherently would translate into more supply, and deeper capital markets. We could also see Indian equities more prominently included in global exchanges, which would lead to more flows,"" he said. India has strong tailwinds supporting its economy, but it needs to undertake several reforms to ensure sustained growth.While India is set to be the world's fourth-largest economy,there is a ""huge disconnect in the standard of living and the social, economic and physical infrastructural between India and Japan,"" Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at TS Lombard said.India'scurrent per capita GDPis $2,880, a fraction of Japan's $33,960, IMF data shows.""There's so much work that really needs to be done in India to bridge this gap and it starts from increasing capital expenditure on infrastructure such as transportation networks, to improving access to education, workforce skills upgrading and jobs in general,"" Deveshwar noted.ANZ's Nim calls India becoming the world's fourth-largest economy merely a ""natural course of events.""""It really means not much to me. India is now the fifth-largest economy, but is not very prosperous, so more work needs to be done to increase the prosperity of citizens,""he said, flagging the need for India to be more open to foreign businesses which already have an incentive to be in the country given its cheap cost structures.He suggests that policymakers strategically identify sectors India has a comparative advantage in, rather than try to manufacture everything. Focusing on select industries over a range of sectors will ensure that the workforce has the needed skills to make quality products that are competitive against those produced in other emerging markets with lower costs.Deveshwar highlights that policymakers should ensure that reforms are meted out quickly, so that growth is sustained. Lack of capacity, manpower and physical infrastructure have historically held back policy rollouts, so effective execution is needed to meet quite aspirational and ambitious targets.""There have been hurdles and lags in policy implementation such as in passing labor reforms, farm reforms and other incomplete reforms that have really delayed the productivity and output in many sectors. We need to fix that so India remains competitive and sustains its position as the world's fourth — or eventually even third largest economy,"" Deveshwar added. A trade deal between India and U.S. could be reached in late June.Negotiations are progressing quicklyand U.S. officials are expected to visit India soon to discuss the deal further, reported CNBC-TV18, which cited government sources. Imports of genetically modified crops from the U.S. will still be prohibited by New Delhi because of regulation, but non-modified agricultural products could see the green light.India's shipment of iPhones to the U.S. jumped in April.Market analyst firm Canalys, now part of Omdia, estimates thattotal shipment rose 76% year on year to around 3,000,000. By contrast, China's iPhone shipments to the U.S. fell to 900,000 in the same month, plummeting roughly 76% from a year earlier. The huge shifts in numbers are because of harsh tariffs the White House imposed on China, Omdia said.U.S. President Donald Trump told Apple CEO Tim Cook he wants iPhones built in America.Smartphones manufactured outside the U.S., whether in ""India, or anyplace else,""wroteTrump on his social media platform Truth Social, will incur a ""Tariff of at least 25%.""

The team is executing with urgency as we look to strengthen both the topline and profit flow-through.""The Pittsburgh retailer's results do not come as a surprise for investors, considering it preannounced some of its results two weeks ago. At that time, it also announced it would withdraw its full-year guidance as it manages slow sales, steep discounting and a volatile macroeconomic environment.Shares fell about 8% in extended trading.Here's how the apparel company did in its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Loss per share: 29 cents adjusted vs. loss of 22 cents expectedRevenue: $1.09 billion vs. $1.09 billion expectedPrior to the preannouncement, analysts had been expecting earnings per share to be an 11-cent profit.The company, which makes fashion clothing targeted at teens and young adults, reported an operating loss for the three-month period that ended May 3 of $85.18 million compared with a net income of $77.84 million a year earlier.Excluding one-time charges related to restructuring and a supply chain optimization project, AEO posted an adjusted operating loss of $68.06 million. The loss also reflects ""higher than planned"" promotions and a write-off of $75 million in spring and summer merchandise.Revenue dropped to $1.09 billion, in line with expectations but down slightly from $1.14 billion a year earlier.Comparable sales were down 3% during the quarter, led by a 4% decline at the company's intimates and activewear line, Aerie. The namesake brand saw comparable sales down 2%.AEO issued downbeat guidance for the second quarter, expecting revenue to be down 5% compared to an estimate of 4%, comparable sales down 3% and gross margin down year-over-year. Its operating income for the second quarter is expected to be between $40 million and $45 million.Schottenstein said during a conference call with investors on Thursday that he was ""disappointed"" by the first-quarter results. He said earlier this month that the $75 million write-off is due to miscalculated merchandising strategies resulting in excess inventory and higher promotions.Jennifer Foyle, president and executive creative director for AE & Aerie, said on Thursday's call that the brand had misses on the merchandising product in a handful of key categories, which was compounded by a cool spring and a slow start to the quarter in February. She said shorts were a tough product across all AEO brands.""Some of our big fashion ideas for the season simply did not resonate with our customer,"" Foyle said, discussing Aerie's performance.Executives on the call repeatedly highlighted the company's goal to be on track for the important back-to-school season later this year.American Eagle is not the only retailer to withdraw or modify financial guidance this year based on PresidentDonald Trump's ever-changingtrade policy.E.l.f. Beauty,Canada Goose,RossandMattelall pulled their full-year guidance recently due to trade uncertainty. Other brands, likeAbercrombie & FitchandMacy'shave cut their profit outlooks.On Thursday's call, CFO Michael Mathias said the company is on track to reduce its sourcing exposure to China to under 10% this year, with the fall and holiday season down to low single digits. He said the mitigated tariff impact to the full year is around $40 million, including a ""couple million dollars"" in the second quarter that is already embedded in the guidance, and the rest is spread out later in the year.During last quarter's call with investors, CFO Michael Mathias said the company sources just under 20% of its products from China. He said then that tariffs could result in a $5 million to $10 million hit and could affect gross margin, although at the time he said the company was not planning on passing costs onto the consumer. On Thursday, the executives did not specify whether prices would be raised.According to AEO'swebsite, the company works with the greatest number of factories in China (101), Vietnam (67) and India (39). It works with just 12 factories in the United States.Before withdrawing its guidance, AEOwarnedback in March that shoppers are pulling back on spending.The company added Thursday that it is on track to complete its $200 million accelerated share repurchase program in the second quarter.As of Thursday's close, AEO stock has fallen roughly 33% year-to-date.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/american-eagle-outfitters-aeo-earnings-q1-2025.html,2025-05-30
320,This start-up is lowering the chances of passing on life-threatening diseases to your children—but it will...,"Biotech start-up Orchid is one of the few companies offering in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) patients the option to screen their embryos for severe genetic diseases before their pregnancy begins.""This technology is going to totally reshape how people have children,"" Orchid's CEO Noor Siddiqui told CNBC'sThe Edgein an interview.""I think it's going to become an option that more and more people will choose because there's just the opportunity to avoid a lot of catastrophic outcomes, and they don't want to roll the dice on their child's health,"" Siddiqui added.During IVF, a woman takes fertility hormones to suppress her natural menstrual cycle and increase the number of eggs in her ovaries. Once her eggs are collected, they are mixed with the sperm and fertilized in a lab. The viable embryos are then transferred to the uterus.Siddiqui says that Orchid has developed a new technology that sequences 99% of an embryo's entire genome before implantation in the womb and screens for over 1,200 monogenic conditions, as well as some polygenic diseases.""When you have an embryo sample, you have about 125 cells on day five, and the embryologist at the IVF lab sends us about five of those cells, and in those five cells, you only have about 10,000 times less than the amount of DNA that you would have in a blood or saliva sample. So, what we had to invent is a new amplification protocol, as well as a new computational pipeline,"" Siddiqui said.The embryo screening process takes between two and three weeks, after which patients receive a whole genome embryo report. Orchid's counselors go through the report and help patients decide which embryo to move forward.Despite having been cleared by the Federal Drug Administration as a laboratory developed test (LDT) and backed by geneticists likeGeorge Churchand Carlos Bustamante, Orchid's procedure has failed to convince some.""These tests, in general, cost money, often not covered by insurance. And so increasingly, breast cancer, for instance, is becoming more a disease of the poor because people can afford to undergo IVF and screen out breast cancer mutations when they've had a family history of breast cancer. I think that raises a problem ethically,"" bioethicist and Columbia University professor Robert Klitzman toldThe Edgein an interview.Orchid currently charges $2,500 per embryo screening. That's in addition to the IVF process which, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, ranges from $15,000 to $20,000 for a single cycle and sometimes requires several attempts. To mitigate the costs, the company has a philanthropic program that patients on low incomes can apply for.Orchid's technology is now available nationwide in the U.S. except in New York state, where Orchid had applied for a license to operate at the time of the interview.Learn more about Orchid's technology by clicking the video above.",,https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/05/29/orchid-the-start-up-working-to-weed-out-genetic-disease-before-birth.html,2025-05-30
321,Musk-Altman AI rivalry is complicating Trump's dealmaking in Middle East,"Elon Musk tried to derail a major AI infrastructure deal in the Middle East, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNBC, following reporting by the Wall Street Journal.OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, Cisco and Emirati firm G42 announced plans to build a sweeping Stargate AI campus in the United Arab Emirates.Musk was frustrated that Sam Altman was tapped for the deal, the person said. Elon Musktried to derail a majorartificial intelligenceinfrastructure deal in the Middle East after learning that his startup, xAI, would be excluded from the initiative, CNBC has confirmed.Earlier this month, OpenAI,Oracle,Nvidia,Ciscoand Emirati firm G42 announced plans to build a sweepingStargate AI campusin the United Arab Emirates. Musk was frustrated that OpenAI, led by personal rival Sam Altman, was tapped for the deal, and he intervened in an effort to get xAI involved, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named in order to speak freely.Musk argued that PresidentDonald Trumpwould not approve the deal, the person said. The announcement was delayed by several days as stakeholders, including the White House, dealt with blowback from Musk, who has been engaged in a public and legal spat with Altman and OpenAI.TheWall Street Journalfirst reported that Musk attempted to block the deal.In a statement to CNBC, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt didn't mention the dustup.""The United States and the UAE signed a groundbreaking framework agreement establishing the first AI acceleration partnership,"" Leavitt said. ""The framework advances the buildout of AI infrastructure in the United States and the UAE. This was another great deal for the American people, thanks to President Trump and his exceptional team.""Musk wasn't in the UAE when the deal was signed, but was with the president in Saudi Arabia during an earlier part of the Middle East trip, according to a senior White House official. The official said Musk has relayed his concerns about the government fairly treating all AI companies.OpenAI declined to comment. Musk didn't respond to CNBC's request for comment.Musk, who is also CEO ofTeslaandSpaceX, is a complicating character in Trump's effort to solidify U.S. leadership in AI. Musk spent close to $300 million to send President Trump back to the White House, and has since been leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), slashing the size of the federal workforce. His time as a special government employee iscoming to an endthis month.When it comes to AI, Musk has in recent years been a vocal critic of Altman, a former friend and colleague. The pair helped form OpenAI as a research lab in 2015, but Musk later had a public break with the project and has consistently criticized its structure and close alliance withMicrosoft.While xAI has been building its commercial efforts,acquiringMusk's social media company X in March and this weekpartneringwith Telegram to roll out its Grok chatbot, Musk has been trying to thwart OpenAI's effort to convert into a for-profit entity.Musk hassuedOpenAI for breach of contract and to try and stop the conversion, and a Musk-led investor group made an unsuccessful bid to buy control of the startup for $97.4 billion in February.It's also not the first time Musk has been critical of Stargate.In January, Trump unveiled the Stargate project, withOpenAI,OracleandSoftbankcommitting an initial $100 billion, and up to $500 billion, of investment in AI infrastructure in the U.S. over four years. Musk was quick to cast doubt on the financing behind the project.""They don't actually have the money,"" Musk wrote in response to an OpenAI post on his social platform X. He later added that SoftBank had ""well under"" $10 billion secured.Two months later, SoftBankleda $40 billion investment in OpenAI at a $300 billion valuation.— CNBC's Eamon Javers contributed to this report.WATCH:Elon Musk tried to block Sam Altman’s big AI deal in the UAE",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/musk-altman-ai-rivalry-complicating-trumps-dealmaking-in-middle-east.html,2025-05-30
322,Amazon taps Xbox co-founder to lead team developing 'breakthrough' consumer products,"The new ZeroOne team at Amazon is looking to expand in Seattle, San Francisco and Sunnyvale, California, according to recent job postings.The group is being led by former Microsoft veteran J Allard, who lists himself as the vice president of ZeroOne on his LinkedIn profile.""If you're excited about working in small, nimble teams to create entirely new product categories and thrive in the ambiguity of breakthrough innovation, we want to talk to you,"" one job post says. Amazon's devices unit has a new team tasked with inventing ""breakthrough"" consumer products that's being led by a formerMicrosoftexecutive who helped create the Xbox.The ZeroOne team is spread across Seattle, San Francisco and Sunnyvale, California, and is focused on both hardware and software projects, according to job postings from the past month. The name is a nod to its mission of developing emerging product ideas from conception to launch, or ""zero to one.""Amazon has a checkered history in hardware, with hits including the Kindle e-reader, Echo smart speaker and Fire streaming sticks, as well as flops like the Fire Phone, Halo fitness tracker and Glow kids teleconferencing device.Many of the products emerged from Lab126, Amazon's hardware research and development unit, which is based in Silicon Valley.The new group is being led by J Allard, who spent 19 years at Microsoft, most recently as technology chief of consumer products, a role he left in 2010, according to hisLinkedIn profile. He was a key architect of the Xbox game console, as well as the Zune, a failed iPod competitor.AllardjoinedAmazon in September, and the company confirmed at the time that he would be part of the devices and services team under Panos Panay, wholeft Microsoftfor Amazon in 2023 to lead the group.An Amazon spokesperson confirmed Allard oversees ZeroOne but declined to comment further on the group's work.The job postings provide few specific details about what ZeroOne is building, though one listing references working on ""conceiving, designing, and bringing to market computer vision techniques for a new smart-home product.""Another postfor a senior customer insights manager in San Francisco says the job entails owning ""the methodology and execution of concept testing and early feedback for ZeroOne programs.""""You'll be part of a team that embraces design thinking, rapid experimentation, and building to learn,"" the description says. ""If you're excited about working in small, nimble teams to create entirely new product categories and thrive in the ambiguity of breakthrough innovation, we want to talk to you.""Amazon has pulled in staffers from other business units that have experience developing innovative technologies, including its Alexa voice assistant, Luna cloud gaming service and Halo sleep tracker, according to Linkedin profiles of ZeroOne employees.

324,Costco tops earnings and revenue estimates as sales jump 8%,"Costco on Thursday posted quarterly earnings and revenue that topped estimates as the warehouse club's sales climbed 8%.The membership club could benefit from tariff volatility as it offers bulk discounts and competitive prices.On the company's earnings call, CEO Ron Vachris said Costco rushed shipments ahead of tariffs and has rerouted goods from countries with higher tariffs to non-U.S. markets. Shares ofCostcofell slightly on Thursday, despite the warehouse club posting quarterly earnings and revenue that topped estimates and reporting 8% year-over-year sales gains.Here's how the warehouse club retailer did in its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share:$4.28 vs. $4.24 expectedRevenue:$63.21 billion vs. $63.19 billion expectedCostco's net income for the three-month period that ended May 11 rose to $1.90 billion, or $4.28 per share, compared with $1.68 billion, or $3.78 a year earlier. Revenue rose from $58.52 billion in the year-ago period.Comparable sales, an industry metric that takes out one-time factors such as store openings and closures, rose 8%, and e-commerce sales rose nearly 16% compared with the year-ago period, excluding gas and the impact of changes to foreign exchange.Unlike many other retailers, Costco does not provide an annual outlook.As tariffs raise economic worries, and potentially consumer prices, Costco could stand to benefit. Unpredictable tariff policy could help drive more customers to the warehouse club, which is known for its competitive prices and bulk discounts, and encourage them to renew membership. Its clubs also sell discounted gas and groceries, which are steadier traffic drivers even when consumers pull back on spending. And compared with some other retailers, Costco has a stronger hand in price negotiations with suppliers because of its large size.About a third of Costco's U.S. sales are goods brought in from other countries, CFO Gary Millerchip said on the company's earnings call. He said items imported from China represent about 8% of total US sales.Some retailers have already warned that higher tariffs will mean higher prices.Best BuyCEO Corie Barry said Thursday thatthe retailer had already raised priceson some consumer electronics because of tariffs. Cosmetics companyE.l.f. Beautyannounceda price increaseon its makeup last week. AndWalmartCFO John David Rainey warned earlier this month thathigher prices were comingto the discounter's stores and website in late May or June.On the company's earnings call, CEO Ron Vachris said Costco has looked for ways to reduce tariff costs while keeping prices low. He said its buyers rushed orders to get them to the U.S. ahead of tariffs. It has rerouted goods from countries with higher tariffs to non-U.S. markets. And it's sourced more items for its private brand, Kirkland Signature, in the countries or regions where the items are sold.Even with tariffs, he said, Costco has lowered the price of some items including eggs, butter and olive oil. He said it's also trying to lean into reasons that customers might sign up for or renew membership, such as extending the hours of its gas stations that sell discounted fuel.Compared to other retailers, Costco sells a slimmer variety of items like having fewer different brands of peanut butter or diapers. Millerchip said that limited approach means Costco is a bigger buyer and can work more closely with suppliers on pricing. He said Costco can also rotate to other items, if needed.In some cases, Costco has absorbed tariff-related cost differences and in other cases, it has raised prices, Millerchip said. For example, the retailer decided to hold the line on the price of pineapples and bananas from Central and South America because they are staple items for shoppers, he said.""We felt it was important to to really eliminate the impact there for the member by working with our suppliers and by us finding efficiencies and accepting that there may be a margin impact,"" he said.On the other hand, he said, it decided to increase the price for flowers from Central and South America since those are a more discretionary items.As of Thursday's close, shares of Costco are up about 10% so far this year. That has outpaced the S&P 500's less than 1% gains during the same period.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/costco-cost-q3-2025-earnings.html,2025-05-30

The10-year Treasuryyield slid about 5 basis points to 4.438%. The2-yearyield ticked down by almost 5 basis points to 3.945%.One basis point is equivalent to 0.01%, and yields move inversely to prices. The U.S. Court of International Tradeinvalidated Trump's universal ""reciprocal tariffs""imposed on international trade partners in early April, on Wednesday, and ordered a permanent stop to the duties in this case as well as future modifications.

The administration could ask the Supreme Court tohaltthe ruling as early as Friday. An appeals court on Thursday afternoongrantedthe Trump administration's request for a pause on the lower-court ruling.Rates also fell as the Federal Reserve said Chair Jerome Powell told Trump in a Thursday meeting that the next interest rate decisions would be based on""non-political"" analysis.The statement likely dashed the hopes of some traders and some in the administration that Powell would preemptively cut rates to ease any setback to economic growth from tariff policy.Data showing jobless claims rising more than expected last week also raised concern about the health of the labor market.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/us-treasury-yields-federal-trade-court-blocks-trumps-tariffs.html,2025-05-30
327,The West is recycling rare earths to escape China’s grip — but it’s not enough,"China controlled 69% of rare earth mine production in 2024, and nearly half of the world's reserves.There are barely any alternatives to China for obtaining the rare earths.""You cannot build a modern car without rare earths,"" an analyst said. BEIJING — As China tightens its grip on the global supply of key minerals, the West is working to reduce its dependence on Chinese rare earth.This includes finding alternative sources of rare earth minerals, developing technologies to reduce reliance, and recovering existing stockpiles through recycling products that are reaching the end of their shelf life.""You cannot build a modern car without rare earths,"" said consulting firm AlixPartners, noting how Chinese companies have come to dominate the supply chain for the minerals.In September 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense invested$4.2 million in Rare Earth Salts, a startup that aims to extract the oxides from domestic recycled products such as fluorescent light bulbs. Japan's Toyota has also been investing in technologies toreduce the useof rare earth elements.According to theU.S. Geological Survey, China controlled 69% of rare earth mine production in 2024, and nearly half of the world's reserves.Analysts from AlixPartners estimate that a typical single-motor battery electric vehicle includes around 550 grams (1.21 pounds) of components containing rare earths, unlike gasoline-powered cars, which only use 140 grams of rare earths, or about 5 ounces. More than half of the new passenger cars sold in China are battery-only and hybrid-powered cars, unlike the U.S., where they are still mostly gasoline-powered.""With slowing EV uptake (in the U.S.) and mandates to convert from ICE to EV formats receding into the future, the imperative for replacing Chinese-sourced materials in EVs is declining,"" said Christopher Ecclestone, principal and mining strategist at Hallgarten & Company.""Pretty soon, the first generation of EVs will be up for recycling themselves, creating a pool of ex-China material that will be under the control of the West,"" he said.  Only 7.5% of new U.S. vehicle sales in the first quarter were electric, a modest increase from a year ago, according to Cox Automotive. It pointed out that around two-thirds of EVs sold in the U.S. last year were assembled locally, but manufacturers still rely on imports for the parts.""The current, full-blown trade war with China, the world's leading supplier of EV battery materials, will distort the market even more."" Of the 1.7 kilograms (3.74 pounds) of components containing rare earths found in a typical single-motor battery electric car, 550 grams (1.2 pounds) are rare earths. About the same amount, 510 grams, is used in hybrid-powered vehicles using lithium-ion batteries.  In early April, China announced export controls on seven rare earths. Those restrictions included terbium, 9 grams of which is typically used in a single-motor EV, AlixPartners data showed.None of the six other targeted rare earths are significantly used in cars, according to the data. But April's list is not the only one. Aseparate Chinese list of metal controlsthat took effect in December restricts exports of cerium, 50 grams of which AlixPartners said is used on average in a single-motor EV.The controls mean that Chinese companies handling the minerals must get government approval to sell them overseas. Caixin, a Chinese business news outlet, reported on May 15, just days after a U.S.-China trade truce, thatthree leading Chinese rare earth magnet companieshave received export licenses from the commerce ministry to ship to North America and Europe.What's concerning for international business is that there arebarely any alternatives to Chinafor obtaining the rare earths. Mines can take years to get operating approval, while processing plants also take time and expertise to establish.""Today, China controls over 90% of the global refined supply for the four magnet rare earth elements (Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb), which are used to make permanent magnets for EV motors,"" the International Energy Agency said in a statement. That refers to neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium. For the less commonly used nickel metal hydride batteries in hybrid cars, the amount of rare earths goes up to 4.45 kilograms, or nearly 10 pounds, according to AlixPartners. That's largely because that kind of battery uses 3.5 kilograms of lanthanum.""I estimate that around 70% of the over 200 kilograms of minerals in an EV goes through China, but it varies by vehicle and manufacturer. It's hard to put a definitive figure on it,"" said Henry Sanderson, associate fellow at The Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security. However, there are limits to recycling, which remains challenging, energy-intensive and time-consuming. And even if adoption of EVs in the U.S. slows, the minerals are used in far larger quantities in defense.For example, the F-35 fighter jetcontains over 900 pounds of rare earths, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, based in Washington, D.C.China's rare earths restrictions alsogo beyond the closely watched listreleased on April 4. In the last two years, China has increased its control over a broader category of metals known ascritical minerals. In the summer of 2023, China said it wouldrestrict exports of gallium and germanium, both used in chipmaking. About a year later, it announcedrestrictions on antimony, used to strengthen other metals and a significant component in bullets, nuclear weapons production and lead-acid batteries.The State Council, the country's top executive body, in October released an entire policy forstrengthening controls of exports, including minerals, that might have dual-use properties, or be used for military and civilian purposes. One restriction that caught many in the industryby surprisewas on tungsten, a U.S.-designated critical mineral but not a rare earth. The extremely hard metal is used in weapons, cutting tools, semiconductors and car batteries.China produced about80% of the global tungsten supplyin 2024, and the U.S. imports 27% of tungsten from China, data from the U.S. Geological Survey showed.About 2 kilograms of tungsten is typically used in each electric car battery, said Michael Dornhofer, founder of metals consulting firm Independent Supply Business Partner. He pointed out that this tungsten is not able to return to the recycling chain for at least seven years, and its low levels of use might not even make it reusable.""50% of the world's tungsten is consumed by China, so they have business as usual,"" Lewis Black, CEO of tungsten mining company Almonty, said in an interview last month. ""It's the other 40% that's produced (in China) that comes into the West that doesn't exist.""He said when the company's forthcoming tungsten mine in South Korea reopens this year, it would mean there would be enough non-China supply of the metal to satisfy U.S., Europe and South Korean needs for defense.But for autos, medical and aerospace, ""we just don't have enough.""",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/china-controlled-rare-earths-account-for-3-pounds-of-an-electric-car-ev.html,2025-05-30
328,UK economy shows signs of positive momentum — but it may not be out of the woods,"Data on Friday signaled unexpected positive momentum in the U.K. economy.The outlook for the U.K. has seesawed over the past year, amid economic slowdowns, mounting concern about fiscal spending plans, and landmark trade deals with major economies.Economists appeared divided on Friday about what the latest bout of data meant for the U.K.'s bigger economic picture. It's been rare for a string of positive economic news to emerge out of the U.K. in 2025 — but this week in particular has given Britain three reasons to be optimistic.Data on Friday signaled unexpected positive momentum in the country's economy, with retail salesrising by a much better-than-expected 1.2% in April, and GfK's consumer confidence index showing an improvement in sentiment.Sterling gained 0.6% against the U.S. dollar after the figures were published on Friday, to trade at around $1.35.The combination of the two positive figures on Friday bucked expectations, and logic, for some economists. Economic activity in April was widely expected to show a downtrend, in part thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump's global trade war.""Well now, that challenges the idea of a cautious consumer,"" said Rob Wood, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, adding that a number of factors, some not influenced by politicians or businesses, were at play.""That said, official sales growth looks too good to be true, likely as the seasonal adjustment fails to adequately control for the later Easter this year,"" Wood added. ""There's no doubt the weather helped a lot, with both March and April registering the most sunshine since records began."" Taken in isolation, Friday's retail figures and consumer confidence data perhaps point to growth in the current quarter. However, British electricity regulator Ofgem added to the positive sentiment by declaring on Friday that electricity prices are set to decline by 7% in July. That could potentially fuel spending in other sectors in the coming months.""This is certainly an improvement for household expenses, with monthly bills likely to fall on average by around £11,"" said Ellie Henderson, economist at Investec.Meanwhile, the string of positive elements could potentially bump up U.K. economic growth for the second quarter as a whole, according to Allan Monks, chief U.K. economist at JPMorgan who is forecasting a 0.6% annualised gain.  ""With the household savings rate so high, a continued improvement in confidence has the potential to unlock further consumer spending gains,"" JP Morgan's Monks said in a note to clients on Friday. ""High inflation, softer wage growth and weak employment argue against a continuation of that trend. But the rise in confidence in May was matched by a notable drop in unemployment fears, lower inflation expectations and a rise in spending intentions.""The outlook for the U.K. has seesawed over the past year. The country has grappled with setbacks likeunexpected economic contractionand mounting concern about fiscal spending plans, while also seeing some more positive data and the agreement of landmark trade deals withthe U.S.,Indiaandthe EU.Earlier this week, official figures showed the economygrew by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2025— although that came as domesticinflation surged to 3.5%in April. Last week, anotherdata printshowed average earnings in the U.K. had grown by 5.9% on an annual basis.The mix of data meant economists appeared divided on Friday about what the latest bout of data meant for the U.K.'s long term economic picture.Alex Kerr, U.K. economist at Capital Economics, warned that ""the sun won't shine on [Britain's] retail sector forever.""""Although for the first time since 2015, excluding the pandemic, retail sales volumes have risen for four months in a row, April's impressive 1.2% m/m rise was largely driven by the unusually warm weather,"" he said in a note sent shortly after the figures were published.""That boost won't last. So even though consumer confidence ticked up slightly in May, we suspect retail sales growth will slow over the coming months."" While most economists viewed the small increase in consumer confidence in May as a positive signal for next quarter's economic growth, others suggested that as overall sentiment remains below pre-pandemic levels, the link between spending and sentiment may be broken instead.""Depressed British consumers have resorted to retail therapy to cope with their economic and financial woes,"" said Andrew Wishart, senior UK economist at Berenberg.Instead, Wishart said a combination of the pandemic, and the ensuing inflation and interest rate hikes led consumers to shore up their finances.""Households have increased their saving rate (the share of household income not spent) to a level previously unseen outside of periods of mass unemployment,"" Wishart added.Having stabilized their bank balances and secured pay rises, consumers are now spending in anticipation of a more stable interest rate and price environment, according to the economist.Counter intuitively, the additional spending means the Bank of England was more likely to hold rates for the rest of the year, than cut, he added. Janet Mui, head of market analysis at wealth manager RBC Brewin Dolphin, said in an email on Friday morning that with wage growth now outpacing inflation, U.K. households are spending more generously. However, she cautioned that the state of Britain's public finances ""remain a constraint.""""With higher borrowing costs, more tax rises and departmental spending cuts may happen,"" she explained. ""This poses some medium-term growth risks for the U.K amid ongoing uncertainty with how the global trade situation will settle.""",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/23/will-the-uk-economy-grow-in-2025-economists-divided-after-data-prints.html,2025-05-30

330,Non-alcoholic beer to pass ale as second-largest global beer category this year,"Non-alcoholic beer is projected to overtake ale as the second-largest beer category worldwide this year, according to IWSR.Younger consumers have been drinking less alcohol, fueling the trend.Major beer brands like Guinness, Budweiser and Heineken have rolled out non-alcoholic alternatives over the last five years. Non-alcoholic beer is on track to overtake ale as the second-largest beer category by volume worldwide this year, according to anew projectionsfrom industry tracker IWSR.While overall beer volume fell roughly 1% in 2024, volume for its non-alcoholic counterpart grew 9% worldwide, according to IWSR. The category's growth accelerated in 2018 and has continued to outstrip the broader beer market since then.IWSR is projecting that no-alcohol beer will grow by 8% annually through 2029, while ale's volume is expected to slide 2% annually in that same period.Despite recent growth, no-alcohol beer is far from becoming the top-selling beer category globally and only holds about 2% of worldwide beer market share. With 92% market share, lager is far and away the largest beer category and still growing, albeit at a slower pace than non-alcoholic beer.No-alcohol beer has gained popularity as more consumers cut back on their alcohol consumption, prompting brewers to invest in zero-proof alternatives. The trend is particularly striking across younger age cohorts; Gen Z drinks less than prior generations at the same age, and millennials hold the largest share of no-alcohol drinkers,according to IWSR. Younger drinkers use buzzwords like""sober curious""and ""damp lifestyle"" to describe moderating their alcoholic intake, rather than abstaining entirely.Additional fuel for the trend comes from the companies making non-alcoholic beers, which have gotten better at mimicking the taste of their alcoholic twins. Practically every major beer brand, fromDiageo'sGuinness toHeinekenandAnheuser-Busch InBev'sBudweiser, has rolled out a zero-proof version over the last five years.Non-alcoholic beer's worldwide retail sales surpassed $17 billion in 2023, according to Bernstein. Looking at global markets, Germany, Spain and Japan bought the most non-alcoholic beer that year. The U.S. landed in sixth place for its no-alcohol beer sales, although its ranking falls much further when measured by overall sales penetration.Much of the growth in the U.S. is fueled by Athletic Brewing, now the top-selling no-alcohol beer brand. The upstart, which was founded in 2018, holds 17% of the category's volume share, edging out AB InBev's Bud Zero and Heineken's 0.0 version. Just three years earlier, Athletic held only a 4% share. The company wasreportedly valuedat roughly $800 million in its latest funding round in 2024.Even non-alcoholic beer hasn't been immune from the rash ofcelebrity-backed alcohol brands. Actor Tom Holland launched Bero, retired basketball star Dwyane Wade co-founded Budweiser Zero with AB InBev and podcast host and actor Dax Shepherd created Ted Segers.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/non-alcoholic-beer-to-pass-ale-in-sales-volume-this-year.html,2025-05-30
331,German defense firm Renk looks to struggling auto sector for new talent as it scales up,"Renk is among the defense firms that has seen its stock rally on the back of increased military spending.To keep pace with the soaring demand defense companies like Hensoldt and Rheinmetall are increasingly collaborating with the automotive industry.Renk CEO Alexander Sagel told CNBC that it has seen a range of applicants from the automotive industry and is ""of course"" benefiting from incorporating such experts. Tank parts makerRenkis eyeing up talent from the auto sector as it races to scale up and fuel growth in the wake of rising geopolitical tensions and soaring military spending.Earlier this year Germany passed ahistoric fiscal packagethat enabled a steep increase in the defense spending capabilities of Europe's largest economy. The 27-member state bloc is scaling up its defense efforts amid the war in Ukraine and the increasingly strained transatlantic security partnership.Renk, a global leader in creating gear boxes for tanks, is among the defense firms that hasseen its stock rallyon the back of increased military spending. Its share price rose over 300% so far this year and its order bookjumped164% to 549 million euros ($622.3 million) in the first quarter.To keep pace with the soaring demand, defense companies like Renk,Hensoldt,Rheinmetallare increasingly collaborating with the automotive industry. It's a sector which historically has been one of Germany's most important economic pillars, but has been facingmajor difficultiesdue to the country's sluggish economy, increased competition from China and U.S. tariffs.For Renk, this cross-industry collaboration has mainly consisted of hiring workers from the automotive industry, capitalizing on CEO Alexander Sagel and Chief Operating Officer Emmerich Schiller's previous experience working in this sector.Sagel has previously held positions at Rheinmetall and Daimler, which has since been renamed to Mercedes-Benz Group AG, while Schiller has worked in various management roles at Mercedes-AMG GmbH. In an exclusive interview from Renk's headquarters in Augsburg, Germany, CEO Sagel told CNBC's Annette Weisbach that the tank-parts supplier has seen a range of applicants from the automotive industry and is ""of course"" benefiting from incorporating such experts.Schiller confirmed the trend, adding, ""We are looking really for engineers who have that education, who can adapt to our industry and bring in the methods which we have in automotive like continuous improvement, like lineback principles to increase efficiency — to increase quality, this is what we are really looking for."" A branch of Germany's largest trade union, IG Metall Lower Saxony, told CNBC it has seen cases of defense firms targeting skilled workers and collaborative opportunities with German carmakers and manufacturers.""These developments are taking place against the backdrop of two parallel dynamics: The automotive industry is undergoing a profound transformation process – key words [are]: electrification, digitalization, new mobility concepts – while at the same time the defense-related sector is expanding due to political decisions and increased defense budgets,"" a spokesperson from IG Metall Lower Saxony said, in emailed comments translated by CNBC.While there are technological connections between the two industries and job creation is welcome, IG Metall warns of a ""one-sided industrial policy focus towards rearmament,"" which may provide employment in the short term but is based on an unstable security environment. ""Our goal has to be a lasting peace, not continuous rearmament,"" the spokesperson said. In aDeutsche Bank notefrom March, analysts led by Adrian Cox explained that overcapacity is an issue across Europe's auto industry, particularly in Germany, where they estimate 100,000 jobs are now be at risk. Auto factories are lying idle while the defense sector remains ""subscale,"" the analysts said, adding that experienced auto workers can benefit the defense industry as it ""moves to serial production and greater profitability.""There is ""a historic opportunity to kill two birds with one stone by turning some of [Germany's] automaking prowess to military production,"" the analysts commented.""The German automotive industry is now increasingly talking to adjacent sectors,"" a spokesperson from the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) told CNBC.""In contrast to industry, Germany is no longer internationally competitive as a business location,"" they said, adding that they ""welcome anything that upgrades Germany as a production location in order to maintain and create growth, prosperity and jobs in Germany.""When asked about the shifts from automotives to defense, Monika Schnitzer, the chair of the German Council of Economic Experts,told CNBC's Squawk Box Europeon Tuesday that it's a chance ""we should seize.""Given the guarantee that auto industry layoffs will happen, these workers ""will be needed somewhere else"" and therefore it'll be key ""to ease this transition by actually bringing people from one company to another company where they are needed"" and also foster reskilling, she added.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/germanys-renk-looks-to-auto-sector-for-new-talent-as-it-scales-up.html,2025-05-30

That's a $10 trillion total addressable market,"" Tsai said.""Name another industry that has a ten trillion TAM. That's why everybody should be excited about AI,"" he added.Other industry heavyweights weighed in on AI's biggest growth opportunities.""The place to be is the infrastructure of AI because over the next two, three, five years, that's where the multiple expansion occurs, and you want to extract profit from it, rather than the revenues,"" said Kamal Bhatia, president and CEO of Principal Asset Management.Discussions about the future of work were also high on the agenda.""We're moving from a 'doing revolution' to a 'thinking revolution.' And frankly, we're moving away from something that impacted the blue collar and the lower workforce into a way that is impacting professional services and white collar, and leadership at a far faster capability,"" Peta Latimer, president of Mercer Asia, told CNBC's Julia Boorstin.""When we talk about the worker, we can no longer talk about job descriptions. We need to start talking about workflows because when you talk about workflows, then the worker actually has a role in whatever job is coming up,"" added Guy Diedrich, SVP and Global Innovation Officer at Cisco.According to a2025 report from McKinsey, more than 70% of all employees surveyed think that generative AI will change 30% or more of their work within two years.

340,A couple who worked in the Maldives and Bali share how living in paradise differs from visiting it,"From the Maldives to Bali to the Cayman Islands, Marc LeBlanc and Laura Robinson have lived and worked in places that most people dream of visiting.They work in the hospitality industry — a journey that LeBlanc, who is Canadian, began at 16 years old when he accepted a job as a dishwasher at a hotel. He worked his way up to bellman, then to the reservations desk, before pursuing a degree in hotel management.Robinson, who is British, studied marine biology and worked as a diving instructor before transitioning to hotel leadership.The couple met while working in the Cayman Islands and have since lived and worked on several islands in Asia, including the small eastern Indonesian island of Sumba.Now they reside in Shinta Mani Wild, a luxury resort tucked away in Cambodia's Cardamom Mountains, where LeBlanc serves as the hotel's general manager, and Robinson oversees operations and sustainability. The couple frequently speak with hotel guests, many of whom ""are super curious to know about our story,"" said LeBlanc.For starters, working in places like the Maldives — which is known for its ""one island, one resort"" concept — is different from visiting it, he toldCNBC Travel.""You're locked on that island, surrounded by water,"" LeBlanc said. ""You're not really going anywhere … you're kind of stuck there for long periods of time.""For employees, resort life centers on a staff village, where workers sleep, eat and do laundry — a situation LeBlanc likened to a summer camp.""It becomes a little community of its own,"" Robinson said. ""You still have the same challenges that having a large group of people living together can present. There are differences in personalities and opinions.""Managing those differences is important, she said, especially in places like the Maldives, which has a multicultural workforce. That has been easier at Shinta Mani Wild, because ""except a few of us, everyone is Cambodian,"" she said.Many people think that working in hospitality is about ensuring guests are having a good time. But ""you've got 100 [employees] that you've got to make sure are happy"" too, she said.Robinson said she and LeBlanc celebrate staff birthdays and other events at the hotel. ""Marc sometimes gets his decks out and DJs for them, which they adore,"" she said.While island life spells sun and fun for most travelers, saltwater creates maintenance issues for those working behind the scenes, Robinson said. In the Cambodian forest, the environmental challenges are different. ""Here you've got the humidity and the forest trying to reclaim itself,"" she said.Shinta Mani Wild has 15 guest tents, but the resort sits on land that ""is the size of Central Park,"" and it requires a ""very high level of attention to detail, in terms of product and service, butalso the conservation work that we do,"" LeBlanc said.He said staff patrol the property, including a large farm on the land, while also maintaining the trails that run through it.""It's new for us,"" he said. ""We're learning."" Life in some of the world's most coveted travel destinations has its perks, but LeBlanc and Robinson also contend with living far from their families.When they lived in the Maldives, their parents visited them yearly, and they returned home every other year to see siblings, said Robinson.Now the couple travel home every year, she said. ""My brother and sister started having kids … and our parents are getting older.""The couple do not have children, so schooling — a big consideration for many expatriates — isn't an issue. They recently adopted two dogs from the Cardamom Mountains forest, they said. LeBlanc and Robinson discussed another challenge: living and working in remote locations as a couple.""Initially you don't know how it's going to go,"" said LeBlanc. But ""we work quite well together."" ""We're still doing it,"" Robinson said with a laugh, adding that separate offices are key.As the general manager of Shinta Mani, LeBlanc oversees matters related to human resources, finance, security and engineering at the hotel, while Robinson handles more ""front of house"" matters, she said.""[Laura is] highly organized, highly efficient, and I'm more on the creative side,"" LeBlanc said.Robinson said LeBlanc comes up with bold ideas and is skilled at executing them. The couple spend time, even on personal holidays, brainstorming ideas — often finding inspiration from their travels, she said.""There's no shortage of places looking for managing couples,"" LeBlanc said. ""There are recruitment firms that specialize in hiring couples, not only for hotels, but also for private islands, for ultra-high net worth individuals. The job opportunities are out there.""In remote destinations, having a companion can ease loneliness too, said LeBlanc.""It makes sense, we have each other,"" he said.Want to boost your confidence, income and career success?Take one (or more!) ofSmarter by CNBC Make It's expert-led online courses,which aim to teach you the critical skills you need to succeed that you didn't learn in school.

341,How China's property bubble burst,"Desperate property developers in China have resorted to gifts like new cars, free parking spaces, phones and other consumer goods to attract homebuyers and boost flagging sales.These incentives are just the tip of the iceberg in a crisis involving hundreds of billions of dollars in home builder debt, trillions in local government debt and at least a billion empty apartments.But it wasn't always the case. Since China's economic liberalization in the 1970s and housing reforms in the late 1980s, locals have flocked to properties as the investment vehicle of choice over alternatives such as the stock market.The property and construction boom helped fuel China's – and the world's – economic growth for 30 years. By some estimates, property in China was worth $60 trillion at its peak, making it the biggest asset class in the world.Developers likeEvergrandeandCountry Gardengot extremely rich in the process.As property values soared and Chinese households piled on more debt, Beijing attempted to cool its housing market and rein in risky business behavior. Spooked, Chinese consumers soured on property purchases.But the country's property crisis has deeper roots than speculation and uncontrollable debt.

343,"SXSW 2025 live coverage: Health tips from Bryan Johnson, concerns about Elon Musk, and what it’s like to actually ride a Waymo Uber on the conference’s final day","Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us TechCrunch will be on the ground at SXSW 2025 — the annual tech, music, comedy, and film conference that kicked off Friday in Austin — in search of the zeitgeist of this AI-centric era.

The tech portion of the annual event kicked off Friday and will run through March 13.The conference begins with several tracks that fall squarely in TechCrunch’s area of interest, including the creator economy, culture, startups, health and medtech, and energy. Folks, it’s time to hit the dusty trail and leave Austin and SXSW 2025 behind. The official conference ended Thursday evening and the music festival, which lasts another two nights, took over. We marked the end of the conference with some tacos and Billboard’s The Stage at SXSW with headliner Koe Wetzel. Tech had a lighter footprint at the conference this year, particularly in the exhibition hall. But we still found lots of founders, some investors, interesting onstage interviews, and Bluesky Jay Graber’s cheeky wardrobe choice that called for“A world without Caesars.” Not to mention lots of robotaxis. On the transportation beat,Rivian,Uber, and Waymomade the biggest splash. But AI was the real star, at least in terms of stage time. AI popped up in every conversation — on stage and off — from sports and entertainment to enterprise, social media, and urban development. The messaging fell squarely in thecautious optimism campwith a few folks likeSignal President Meredith Whittakerandauthor Kasley Killamissuing sterner warnings of the risks from AI. See y’all next year. At SXSW, Tern AIdemonstrated exclusivelyfor TechCrunch that its low-cost alternative to GPS could “derive a position from nothing” — “No triangulation, no satellites, no Wi-Fi, nothing.” All Tern’s intelligent system uses is a cocktail of cached map information and a vehicle’s existing sensor data. “Your GPS cannot initialize position without that triangulation process, and so we think it’s a rather important innovation to be able to determine position organically within the vehicle,” Brett Harrison, co-founder and president, told TechCrunch. “[Tern] turns all these vehicles that you see into creators and originators of position information instead of consumers of it.” Our most critical systems, from aviation to disaster response to precision farming, rely on GPS. Foreign adversaries have already demonstrated that they can spoof GPS signals, which could have catastrophic impacts both on the economy and national security. Which makes finding alternatives all the more important. Read more about Tern AI’s mission and my demo with the Austin-based startup’s tech! In the same way that genome sequencing determines the genetic makeup of an organism, Bryan Johnson — the investor and founder behind theDon’t Diemovement — wants to start “foodome” sequencing. “We’re going to sequence the U.S. ‘foodome,’ which means test 20% of foods that constitute 80% of the American diet based on stuff we eat everyday,” Johnson said Thursday at SXSW. Johnson is the founder and former CEO of Kernel, a brain monitoring device company, founder of OS Fund, and founder and former CEO of e-commerce company Braintree. “I want to be real with you, it’s just very, very hard to buy clean food,” he said, noting that most foods from grocery stores, even the organic brands, could have toxins in them from the way the food was processed. His goal is to test all of the food and create a public database where people can donate money to have certain foods and brands tested for toxins like heavy metals or microplastics, and then use the results to hold brands accountable for unsafe food practices. TheWaymo on Uber robotaxi servicelaunched in Austin a week before SXSW and it’s been a challenge actually matching with one. In Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, consumers use the Waymo One app to hail a ride. And it’s always a robotaxi. Here in Austin, consumers use the Uber app and sometimes they’re matched with a robotaxi. Usually they get a human driver. Waymo helped TechCrunch coordinate a robotaxi ride. And that was fine and all, but we wanted an experience that was less orchestrated. We got lucky Thursday morning and were matched. The drive itself was uneventful, although the route was longer than what Google Maps suggested (I always compare). Waymo told me that the vehicles were being routed around certain areas, which may explain the difference. We did notice some new stuff though. Namely, the user interface, which includes the two displays inside the vehicle that shows the robotaxi and its surroundings. Waymo confirmed the updates and noted that these occur continuously. Here’s what we spotted. The display now shows the turn signals, hazards, and brake lights of vehicles in front of, and around, the robotaxi. Waymo now colors pedestrians, cyclists, and parked vehicles differently and the display highlights the destination building as the rider arrives at their drop off point. Finally, the Waymo display shows stop signs and traffic cones. Kirsten and I turned our tech brains off for a couple of hours to treat ourselves to a film, and I gotta say, “The Rivals of Amziah King” is THE PERFECT SXSW film. The movie, which is the first film Matthew McConaughey has been in in six years, has a healthy dose of Southern charm, strong themes of honor culture, heartwarming comedy, and a constant current of live bluegrass music that is so soulful, it’ll challenge anyone who claims they don’t like country.It also received astanding ovation at the premiere. And, welp, that doesn’t happen every day. I almost don’t want to tell you anything else about this film. I went in blind, and I was enthralled by every unexpected plot turn and camera angles. All you need to know is, everyone in that theater laughed, cried, jumped, and tapped their feet to the music. I have a newfound respect for both bees and the humble mandolin. The former director of Twitter’s machine ethics teamhad some choice wordsabout Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency onstage at SXSW on Thursday. “When your funding is frozen and you don’t know if you’re gonna be fired, and there’s this, like, absolutely unhinged person saying weird things on the internet constantly, you still have to do your job, right?” Chowdhury said. “The lights have to be kept on because Elon Musk is not the one keeping the lights on, even though he would like you to think that.” Chowdhury said she fears the brain drain resulting from the dramatic reductions and chaotic management style. We’re here for the final day of the SXSW conference, which means the tech talks will end and the music goes to 11. We will bid adieu by tonight, but first let’s catch up on a bit of tech.The exhibition hall within the Austin Convention Center was light on tech. Really,reallylight on tech. In years past, the hall was brimming with startups. This year, I found them in the installations and activations outside of the convention center, including Midwest House, Ireland House, and Funded House. Oh, and of course the parties too. Founders were out and about — and looking for funding. There were delegations of founders too, coming from Europe, Australia, and Brazil. Notably, I didn’t encounter much chatter of dual-use or defense startups. Although that might have been due to circumstances — SXSW tends to spread out.Quantum computing has been having a moment at SXSW with several talks on Wednesday and today. Plus, Marc Maron, the comedian whose podcast “WTF with Marc Maron,” receives over 80 million listeners per year,riffedon a lot of topics, including an earnest exclamation that the podcast will never get into video.And we managed to get matched with a Waymo robotaxi with the Uber app. Hooray. More on that in a moment. Remember thatSan Jose grant program for AI startupsI mentioned yesterday? Well, we’ve got some more details on that now. The city officially opened applications for grants to incentivize AI startups to move to downtown San Jose. There are three $50,000 grants on offer and another for $25,000 to AI companies at any stage that are looking to create a presence in the city. Bonus points if the startup focuses on civic problems for social good. “We have seen a growing narrative that the Bay Area is a tough place to do business,” San Jose mayor Matt Mahan told TechCrunch. “People are worried about the high cost of living, the lack of affordable housing, and have a lot of concern about whether or not they should start a company in the Bay Area, and we want to take on those concerns head-on.” Correction: This post has been updated to reflect the correct grant amounts Singer, songwriter, and leader of Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) John Fogerty is apparently keeping up with the times. Duringhis SXSW keynoteon Wednesday in Austin, Texas, the musician joked about using ChatGPT to determine which songs to play for his shows. In an interview conducted by Tom Morello (of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave), Fogerty was asked how he decided on a setlist for a given evening, like his concert at SXSW the previous night. “I just go on ChatGPT or whatever,” Fogerty said, leading the audience to howl with laughter. He then added that “you learn a whole lot trying to be an entertainer,” and said he just wanted people to have fun at the concert. “I want them to join in. I want them to sing along.” The interview also touched on CCR history, music publishing rights, and the stories behind some of the band’s songs, among other things. At one point, Fogerty also pointed out how the medium we use to consume music defines how it’s presented. “Songs have always sort of been manifested by the medium that they’re on. I mean, the three-minute song or so was invented because of the 78 record. You just couldn’t put more stuff in there,” he said. Then the LP came along and CDs, which led to people having albums with far more songs, even 19- or 21-track albums.” (He said he didn’t think this was a great idea, for what it’s worth, adding that “after six or seven songs, put it on the next record!”) Today, the medium we use to consume music is streaming, which means that distribution is in some ways more democratic, Morello said, although there’s less of a funnel as thousands of new songs are released daily. CCR has over a billion streams, however, which Fogerty said was “magical and remarkable.” “If your song is streamed, especially to a great degree, it means that young people are listening to it, because that’s their media: streaming,” he said. I just moderated my second panel at SXSW: Engineering Joyrides with Gretchen Effgen (director of global automotive partnerships at Google), Pankaj Kedia (VP of commercial partnerships at Dolby), and Alan Wexler (SVP of strategy and innovation at GM). It was a lively discussion about what in-car entertainment looks like today and what it’ll be in the future, as more cars develop autonomous capabilities. The talk followed some news from the three companies.GM a few days ago announcedthat its electric Cadillac OPTIQ and VISTIQ will feature Dolby Atmos immersive sound, available through Amazon Music. It’s the start of a larger rollout of Dolby’s system as a standard feature in certain 2025 and 2026 Cadillac models, and will be available across Cadillac’s entire 2026 EV lineup. The Optiq and other GM vehicles will also have Google built in, meaning they’ll come with Google features like Maps, Assistant, Play, and personalized suggestions. With the software-defined vehicle, cars have the potential to become your living room on wheels. But how will automakers balance cool tech offerings with distracting feature bloat? How much is improving our lives (like Dolby’s sound system), and how much is just frustrating (like everything controlled by a touchscreen)? This story was corrected to note that the immersive sound is available through Amazon Music. Charina Chou, COO ofGoogle Quantum AI, argued for government investment in the quantum computing market, arguing that no company could develop the technology successfully on its own. “The transistor … was funded by U.S. government fundamental research investments in science,” Chou explained whilespeakingat the SXSW conference in Austin on Wednesday. “That is what has given rise even to a lot of the advances we have in quantum computing today — it’s all based on basic science … No one company is going to do this on their own. No one team can do it on their own. You’ve got to have a whole community of researchers. And government investment in this is critical,” she said. In addition, Chou pointed out that China is currently outspending the U.S. two to one on quantum research. Not only would that mean the U.S. could fall behind in critical areas, but there’s also the potential that quantum computing could break the encryption that today protects secure communications. “It’s important to note that that’s expected to take a computer that is one or two orders of magnitude more powerful than that would be required for chemistry materials, so it is farther down the road, but you can imagine that has massive national security implications,” Chou said. “And you would want the U.S. to have that capability.” Chou also talked about the broader potential for quantum computing, the types of problems it could solve, and other mysteries and misunderstandings about the technology. She pointed to possibilities like cancer drug testing, creating a mathematical model of a cell; breaking encryption; building better batteries and solar cells; helping solve the climate crises; optimizing anything from shipping routes to investments, fusion energy, more efficient energy use, and more. “If you took home just one message, it would be that quantum computers are capable of solving problems that are impossible for AI or supercomputers,” Chou said. Ireland’sTaoiseach(prime minister) Micheál Martin made a splash at SXSW with an onstage interview and a visit toIreland House— an activation organized by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the national agency for Irish film Fís Éireann. I happened to be at Ireland House and interviewing Enterprise Ireland’s new CEO Kevin Sherry, when the Taoiseach came to meet with startup founders and folks in the film industry. His SXSW stop is part of a whirlwind tour that includes a visit to the White House. This morning, the Taoiseach attended a St. Patrick’s Day breakfast at Vice President J.D. Vance’s residence and is expected to meet with President Trump. The tour comes at a critical time for Ireland, a small country of about 5 million people that ranks sixth globally for foreign direct investment in the United States. Taoiseach Martin spoke about the economic relationship between the U.S. and Ireland while onstage at SXSW; it’s a relationship that could be affected by the reciprocal trade tariffs that the Trump administration is directing toward the EU, of which Ireland is a member. The Taoiseach’s stopover at Ireland House focused on founders and film, not politics. And many of those founders are connected to Enterprise Ireland, a government agency that supports the development of Irish-owned companies into new markets, including the U.S. Enterprise Ireland is no slouch either. Sherry told me the agency has a fund that invests in between 150 and 180 early-stage startups each year.

345,YouTube will soon let viewers use Google Lens to search what they see while watching Shorts,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us YouTubeannouncedon Thursday that it’s bringing Google Lens to YouTube Shorts in the coming weeks. With this integration, viewers will soon be able to use Google Lens to search what they see while watching Shorts. For example, if you’re watching a Short filmed in a location that you’re interested in visiting, you can select a landmark and ask Lens to identify it. From there, you would be able to learn more about the destination’s culture and history. By integrating Lens into Shorts, YouTube is working to enhance visual search capabilities and give users more ways to discover and search for content in an intuitive and interactive way. It makes sense for the company to enhance search capabilities for YouTube Shorts viewers by leveraging Google Lens, especially since TikTok and Instagram Reels don’t offer similar functionality. Once the functionality rolls out, users will be able to try it out by pausing a Short and then selecting the “Lens” option in the top menu. Then they will need to either draw, highlight, or tap on something they want to search. Lens will then provide visual matches and search results overlaid on the Short. Once you’re done with the Short, you can jump back into the content that you were watching. Users won’t see ads in search results during the beta phase of Lens in Shorts, YouTube says. The Google-owned company also notes that Lens in Shorts isn’t available for Shorts with YouTube Shopping affiliate links or with paid product promotions. YouTube is starting to roll out the beta to all viewers this week. Today’s announcement comes as YouTube has been building out Shorts with added capabilities to take on TikTok and Instagram Reels. In April, YouTubeannounced new upcoming featuresthat are designed to help creators publish engaging short-form videos. Creators will get access to an improved video editor, the ability to generate AI stickers, a feature that syncs content to the beat of a song, enhanced templates, and more.

347,Report: TuSimple sent sensitive self-driving data to China after US national security agreement,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Self-driving truck startup TuSimple (now CreateAI) sent a trove of sensitive data — effectively the blueprint of an American-made autonomous vehicle system — to a Beijing-owned firm after committing to the U.S. government that it would cease such transfers under a national security agreement, according toThe Wall Street Journal. The transfers to Chinese truck manufacturer Foton happened around February2022, just a week after TuSimple signed the agreement in which U.S. regulators ordered the company to separate its business and technology from China-based employees and partners with firewalls and governance controls. The data sharing continued up until TuSimple’s deadline to comply with the agreement six months later, according to hundreds of pages of correspondence that the Journal viewed. A subsequent investigation with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) found the data sharing didn’t technically violate the agreement, though TuSimple was fined for other infractions and paid a $6 million settlement without admitting fault, per the Journal. TechCrunch was unable to reach TuSimple, now CreateAI, for comment. Still, the saga of TuSimple’s data transfers to China exposes the limits of U.S. safeguards meant to balance foreign investment with national security. And it’s not just data that TuSimple has been trying to get across the border. This latest revelation comes eight months afterTechCrunch reportedthat some of TuSimple’s shareholders were trying to block the company from transferring its U.S. funds — roughly $450 million at the time — to the company’s Chinese subsidiary to fund a pivot to AI animation and content generation. That drama is still unfolding as one of TuSimple’s co-founders, Xiaodi Hou, fights in court for control over his voting shares so he canpush for liquidationof the company. In December 2024,TuSimple officially rebranded to CreateAI. The company has been embroiled in controversy since going public via IPO in 2021. TuSimple started as a China-backed startup founded in 2015 by Hou and Lu Chen, an entrepreneur with ties to Sina Corp. It quickly became an autonomous vehicle industry favorite, managing to raise around $2 billion from a mixture of Chinese and U.S.-based heavy hitters, and was one of the first in the U.S. to successfully complete a fully driverless run on public highways. TuSimple’s plans took a turn for the worse amid internal struggles and federal investigations into the company’s ties with China, leading to its decision toexit U.S. operationsand voluntarily delisting from the stock market in January 2024. The goal was to restart self-driving operations in China, but both the CFIUS agreement and other court orders that barred the company from transferring assets — financial or otherwise — to China made it next to impossible to restart operations there, the company has told TechCrunch. The Journal’s reporting sheds light on a previouslyreported controversy regarding Hydron, a Chinese hydrogen trucking startup founded by Chen, which shared an office with TuSimple China. The overlap between Hydron and TuSimple was the subject of the 2022 CFIUS probe, during which TuSimple revealed that its employees spent paid hours working for Hydron in 2021 and shared confidential information with the company. According to documents the Journal viewed, TuSimple negotiated a deal in 2021 between Hydron and Foton to develop autonomous trucks. Foton, a subsidiary of state-owned BAIC Group, has an agreement with a Chinese military university to work on AV tech. Through a combination of emails, Slack messages, and video calls, TuSimple sent partners technical instructions for server dimensions, brake designs, sensors, steering, power supply, and chips, per the Journal. Employees also routinely downloaded autonomy source code developed by their American counterparts. As geopolitical tensions and competition with China rise, TuSimple’s ties are serving as a cautionary tale for Washington that has helped drive ashift in U.S. policy, prompting stricter rules on Chinese-linked tech deals and fueling a broader push to block high-risk transactions outright.

The independent evaluation could prolong the transition, or gum up OpenAI’s plans even further. OpenAI’s conversion will help it attract new investment andeventually go public, but first, the startup needs to secure approvals from state regulators. Although OpenAI and Microsoft have hired their own investment banks to advise on the deal, Delaware’s attorney general is now seeking an independent evaluation of the equity that OpenAI’s nonprofit will receive. Regulators seem to be zeroing in on a key factor in OpenAI’s conversion, which could significantly affect the price OpenAI ultimately pays to simplify its structure. Corporate governance experts sayElon Musk may have raised the price of OpenAI’s nonprofitwhen he submitted a $97.4 billion takeover bid for the startup, despite the fact that OpenAI promptly rejected it.

351,Security startup Horizon3.ai is raising $100M in new round,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Horizon3.ai, a cybersecurity startup that provides tools like autonomous penetration testing, is seeking to raise $100 million in a new funding round and has locked down at least $73 million, the company revealed inan SEC filingthis week. NEA led the round, according to two people familiar with the deal. One person said that the startup is believed to be valued upward of $750 million, although TechCrunch couldn’t verify whether that valuation is pre- or post-money. Another person believes the company did (or will) sell the whole $100 million, and added that the company is generating about $30 million in annual recurring revenue. Neither Horizon nor NEA responded to TechCrunch’s requests for comment. With this deal, Horizon3.ai becomes NEA’s second major cybersecurity startup investment in less than a month, following Veza’s $108 million funding round at an$800 million valuationannounced in April. In August 2023, Horizon3.airaised $40 million in a Series C roundled by Craft Ventures with participation from SignalFire. That round brought the startup’s total fundraising to $78.5 million and was aimed to expand its R&D, channel presence, and team of engineers, co-founder CEO Snehal Antani told TechCrunch at the time. Founded in 2019, Horizon3.ai comprises a team of former U.S. Special Operations cyber operators, entrepreneurs, and cybersecurity experts. Before launching the startup, Antani served as CTO at Splunk and led teams within the U.S. Military’s Joint Special Operations Command. With all things AI being deployed across the tech world, AI-powered automated attacks are alsoon the rise. The San Francisco-based startup Horizon3.ai helps protect against such attacks with its autonomous threat detection tools. Earlier this month, Horizon3.aireceived FedRAMP authorization, enabling it to sell its wares to federal agencies. It also announced in February that it saw101% year-on-year revenue growth, exceeding 150% of its Q4 pipeline targets, without sharing specific numbers.

352,"In a victory for Palmer Luckey, Meta and Anduril work on mixed reality headsets for the military","Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us On Thursday, Anduril and Meta announced news that feels like a fairy tale ending for Anduril co-founder Palmer Luckey. The two companies are working together to build extended reality (XR) devices for the U.S. military, Andurilannouncedin a blog post. “I am glad to be working with Meta once again,” Luckey is quoted as saying in the post. “My mission has long been to turn warfighters into technomancers, and the products we are building with Meta do just that.” This partnership stems from the Soldier Borne Mission Command (SBMC) Next program, formerly called the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) Next. IVAS was a massive military contract, with a total $22 billion budget, originally awarded to Microsoft in 2018 intended to develop HoloLens-like AR glasses for soldiers. But after endless problems, in February the Army strippedmanagement of the program from Microsoft and awarded it to Anduril, with Microsoft staying on as a cloud provider. The intent is to eventually have multiple suppliers of mixed reality glasses for soldiers. All of this meant that if Luckey’s former employer, Meta, wanted to tap into the potentially lucrative world of military VR/AR/XR headsets, it would need to go through Anduril. The devices will be based on tech out of Meta’s AR/VR research center Reality Labs, the post says. They’ll use Meta’s Llama AI model, and they will tap into Anduril’s command and control software known as Lattice. The idea is to provide soldiers with a heads-up display of battlefield intelligence in real time. Luckey is apparently feeling good about this reconciliation. He was, of course,famously firedfrom Facebook in 2017, about three years after Facebook bought his startup Oculus for $2 billion. This came after Luckey was embroiled in a brouhaha over his support for Donald Trump in his 2016 election. Luckey turned around and founded Anduril in 2017, with co-founders Brian Schimpf, Trae Stephens, and Matt Grimm. An Anduril spokesperson tells TechCrunch that the product family Meta and Anduril are building is even called EagleEye, which will be an ecosystem of devices. EagleEye is what Luckey named Anduril’s first imagined headset in Anduril’s pitch deck draft, before his investors convinced him to focus on building software first. “All of them had worked with me for years via Oculus VR, and when they saw the EagleEye headset in our first Anduril pitch deck draft, they pointed out that it seemed like I was sequencing things irrationally. They believed, correctly, that I was too focused on winning a pissing contest over the future of AR/VR, on proving that I was right and the people who fired me were wrong,”Luckey tweetedin February after winning the IVAS contract. After Thursday’s news, Luckeyposted on X: “It is pretty cool to have everything at our fingertips for this joint effort – everything I made before Meta acquired Oculus, everything we made together, and everything we did on our own after I was fired.” And to show that Luckey has really buried the hatchet, he said Anduril has even launched aFacebook page.

353,US government sanctions tech company involved in cyber scams,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The U.S. government imposed sanctions on Funnull, a company accused of providing infrastructure for cybercriminals running “pig butchering” crypto scams that have led to $200 million in losses for American victims. On Thursday, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controlannouncedthe sanctions, saying Funnull is “linked to the majority of virtual currency investment scam websites reported to the FBI.” The press release said that the $200 million in losses results in an average loss of $150,000 per victim, but that the numbers “likely underestimate the total losses, as many victims of scams do not report the crime.” Pig butchering scamsinvolve criminals approaching victims online, often pretending to be interested in a romantic relationship, with the goal of tricking the victims into sending them money to invest in nonexistent crypto projects. According to the Treasury, Funnull is based in the Philippines and run by Chinese-national Liu Lizhi, who was also sanctioned on Thursday. Funnull, according to the Treasury, generated domain names for websites on IP addresses it owns, and provided “web design templates to cybercriminals.” “These services not only make it easier for cybercriminals to impersonate trusted brands when creating scam websites, but also allow them to quickly change to different domain names and IP addresses when legitimate providers attempt to take the websites down,” the Treasury said. The FBIreleased an alertthat included more information about these activities. The Treasury referred tothe Polyfill supply chain attackin its press release, saying Funnell “purchased a repository of code used by web developers and maliciously altered the code to redirect visitors of legitimate websites to scam websites and online gambling sites, some of which are linked to Chinese criminal money laundering operations.” Those activities are exactly whatresearchers from cybersecurity firm Silent Push accused FUNNULL of carrying out last year. Researchers found that Funnull was responsible for the Polyfill supply chain attack, which was launched to push malware to whoever visited websites that used Polyfill’s code. The goal was to redirect users to a malicious network of casino and online gambling sites, the researchers found.

Zach Edwards, a researcher at Silent Push who worked on the Funnull report last year, told TechCrunch that he was “really glad to see the facts aligned with our suspicions.” “It’s encouraging that the Treasury has taken actions against the largest pig butchering and money laundering network that exists targeting people in the U.S., but we know that more needs to be done,” said Edwards. “This effort from Funnull is the tip of the iceberg for what is actually going on right now out of China with financial schemes targeting Americans.” “Global threat actors that are targeting Americans with financial scams need to be held accountable, and doxing the companies they work with and the individuals who run those companies, is an important first step,” he added.

354,"Nvidia GTC 2025 live updates: Blackwell Ultra, GM partnerships, and two ‘personal AI supercomputers’","Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us GTC, Nvidia’s biggest conference of the year, starts this week in San Jose. We’re on the ground covering all the major developments. CEO Jensen Huang will give a keynote address focusing on — what else? — AI and accelerating computing technologies, according to Nvidia.We’re expecting Huang to reveal more about Nvidia’s next flagship GPU series, Blackwell Ultra, and the next-gen Rubin chip architecture. Also likely on the agenda: automotive, robotics, and lots and lots of AI updates. Nvidia announced Thursdayit’s partnering with EPRI, a power industry R&D organization, to use AI to solve problems facing the electrical grid. Perhaps ironically, the issues are largely caused by rising power demandfrom AI itself. The Open Power AI Consortium, which includes a number of electrical utilities and tech companies,saysit will use domain-specific AI models to devise new ways to tackle problems that the power industry is predicted to face in the coming years. The models will be open sourced and available to researchers across academia and industry. The power industry is facingsurging demand from data centersin the United States and elsewhere as AI ramps up the need for computing power. Electricity demand is expected to grow by 4% annually in the coming years,accordingto the International Energy Agency, nearly double over 2023 figures. In January 2025, Jensen Huangcausedquantum computing stocks to crash after saying he believed quantum technology wouldn’t be very useful for the next 15 to 30 years. Huang is now making amends by launching Nvidia’s firstQuantum Day, where he’s moderating a panel with CEOs from some of the same quantum computing companies whose stocks plummeted. In his opening speech, Huang said he never intended to trigger a crash with his remarks — in fact, he had no idea there were public quantum companies to begin with. “When I made that comment, apparently the whole industry’s stock went down 60%,” he said. “And my first reaction was, ‘I didn’t know they were public!’ How could a quantum computer company be public? I discovered they were public companies — I’m very happy for them.” Huang added that he thinks quantum computing holds “extraordinary” promise and noted that Nvidia was built on a similarly long timeline of decades of research and development. This week, Nvidiaannouncedthat it plans to build a new center in Boston to advance the development of quantum computing architectures and algorithms. Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe was interviewed by Nvidia’s VP of automotive Rishi Dhall during GTC on Wednesday. As one might expect, the bulk of the conversation centered around GPUs used for training and simulation and at the edge — in this case, a Rivian vehicle. Toward the end of the talk, Dhall asked Scaringe a series of rapid-fire questions, including “Name one futuristic AI feature you wish Rivian … could develop tomorrow,” and “What’s one AI-powered feature that you wish Rivian and vehicles had right now, but isn’t possible yet?” Scaringe’s answer in both cases? “Self-driving,” although Scaringe added that self-driving isn’t impossible and it’s just a matter of time until it’s achieved and that Rivian has spent considerable time laying the foundation to get there. Last year, Rivian rolled outimprovementsthat allowed the company to launch ahands-free versionof its driver-assistance system for highway driving. The new hands-free feature handles the control steering, acceleration, and braking under certain conditions and locations, but it’s not considered a “Level 4” fully autonomous system. Noam Brown, who leads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, says certain forms of “reasoning” AI models could’ve arrived 20 years earlier had researchers “known [the right] approach” and algorithms. “There were various reasons why this research direction was neglected,” Brown said during a panel atNvidia’s GTC conferencein San Jose on Wednesday. “I noticed over the course of my research that, OK, there’s something missing. Humans spend a lot of time thinking before they act in a tough situation. Maybe this would be very useful [in AI].” Brown was referring to his work on game-playing AI at Carnegie Mellon University, including Pluribus, which defeated elite human professionals at poker. The AI Brown helped create was unique at the time in the sense that it “reasoned” through problems rather than attempting a more brute-force approach. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is speaking at a Q&A for the press at GTC. And he’s pretty tired, the billionaire CEO admitted. “I’m running low on blood sugar. I think I’ve had 100 calories of food over the past two days,” he said after asking for a Diet Coke, or some other caffeinated drink, onstage. Huang also poked fun at some reporters for asking him overly long and technical questions, answering one with a blunt “Yes.” He answered another question about base dies — a central semiconductor component — with a droll comment: “There’s no press release necessary for that optimization.” In the midst of GTC, Nvidia hasreportedlyacquired synthetic data startup Gretel. Terms of the acquisition are unknown. The price tag was said to be nine figures, exceeding Gretel’s most recent valuation of $320 million,according to Wired. San Diego-based Gretel wasfounded in 2019by Alex Watson, Laszlo Bock, John Myers, and Ali Golshan, who also serves as the company’s CEO. The startup fine-tunes models, adds proprietary tech on top, and then packages these models together to sell them. Nvidia’s acquisition is strategic — and timely. Tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic are already using synthetic data to train flagship AI models as theyexhaust sources of real-world data. OpenAI-backed robotics startup 1Xis here in San Jose showcasing its humanoid robot for the home, Neo Gamma. The robot has been vacuuming and watering plants at the convention center where GTC is being held, albeit not autonomously. While 1X says that it’s building in-house AI models to power Neo Gamma’s movements and speech, the robot currently relies on humans to teleoperate it today. Here with the sweater robotpic.twitter.com/yxwtb2vBiA Even with teleoperation, the robot isn’t perfect. Neo Gamma dropped a vacuum a few times on Wednesday. At one point, it started shaking, and then collapsed, only to be caught by 1X’s co-founder, Bernt Børnich. A 1X employee told us the robot was experiencing Wi-Fi issues in the crowded demo hall. The sweater it’s wearing looks amazing, though. A senior research scientist at DeepMind who worked on robotics and AI has left Google to create his own robotics startup, calledGeneralist AI, and it has already obtained investment from Nvidia. Former DeepMind employee Pete Florencewas listedas co-founder and CEO of Generalist AI at a panel at Nvidia’s GTC conference in San Jose on Tuesday. The panel showcased portfolio companies of Nvidia’s VC arm, NVentures. “We are largely still in stealth,” Florence told TechCrunch, explaining that the mission of his startup is “to make general-purpose robots a reality.” Florence joins a string of other DeepMind alums who have founded their own companies, like autonomous coding startupReflection AI, biotech startupLatent Labs,Mistral, and others. Nvidia declined to comment. For more on Generalist AI and what it does,read TechCrunch’s article here. Nvidia-backedJapanese unicorn Sakana AIsays it has created a new benchmark to measure an AI model’s reasoning capabilities — and it’s based on the classic Japanese game of Sudoku. The new benchmark, called Modern Sudoku, “really is perfect” for measuring reasoning capabilities, said Sakana’s CTO Llion Jones during a presentation at GTC. Sudoku is a good way to measure reasoning for a number of reasons, including that it requires very creative long-term reasoning and that vision models aren’t powerful enough to solve Sudoku puzzles yet, Jones said. Sakana has made bold AI claims that didn’t quite pan out before. Ithad to walk back a claim last monththat its latest model could dramatically speed up training. It also claimed an AI-generated paper passed peer review, although thereality was a bit more nuanced than that. In previous years, autonomous vehicles played a larger role in Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s GTC keynote — a reflection of where the technology stood in the hype cycle at the time. But just because talk of AVs has been supplanted by AI, Nvidia is still very much in the business. A slew of automated driving deals were announced at the company’s GTC conference in San Jose, including with startups like Gatik, as well as Torc and General Motors. Lucky for you we have ahandy roundupthat explains exactly what these companies are getting from Nvidia. In aninterview on Wednesday with CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang claimed that the Trump administration’s tariffs won’t do “significant damage” in the short run. “We’ve got a lot of AI to build,” he told the publication. “AI is the foundation, the operating system of every industry going forward. … We are enthusiastic about building in America. Partners are working with us to bring manufacturing here.” Nvidia’s chips are largely fabricated by chipmaker TSMC, which is based in Taiwan. That hasn’t allayedinvestors’ fearsthat future, reciprocal tariffs may impact parts of the company’s business, however. TSMCrecently pledgedto spend “at least” $100 billion on U.S. chip facilities over the next four years. Nvidia iscollaborating with Disney Research and Google DeepMindto develop Newton, a physics engine to simulate robotic movements in real-world settings, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced at GTC 2025 on Tuesday. Disney will be among the first to use Newton to power its next-generation entertainment robots, like the Star Wars-inspired BDX droids — one of which waddled onstage next to Huang during his Tuesday keynote. Nvidia plans to release an early, open source version of Newton later in 2025.

355,Stellantis pivots to Google’s Android as in-car partnership with Amazon ends,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Three years ago, Stellantis announced it waspairing up with Amazonto create in-car software that would bring a slew of connected products and services to vehicles by 2024 as part of the automaker’s broader plan to generate $22.5 billion annually from software. That never happened. And now the partnership is “winding down,”Reuters reported. The article also reported that Amazon staff working on the project had been reassigned or left the company, according to unnamed sources. Stellantis confirmed the Reuters report and told TechCrunch it would be pivoting to an Android-based system. “Amazon remains a valuable partner for Stellantis, and the companies continue to work together on a range of initiatives,” the automaker said in a statement. For instance, Stellantis will continue to use Amazon Web Services as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms. Amazon’s Alexa will also continue to be available in Stellantis vehicles. Stellantis laid out an ambitious plan in December 2021 to have 34 million connected cars on the road by 2030. The pitch was that Stellantis would be setting itself up for a new stream of revenue beyond building and selling vehicles. Stellantis struck partnerships with BMW, Foxconn, Waymo, and Amazon to reach that target. The plan to use in-car software to sell passengers and drivers products and subscriptions involved three components. It started with an underlying electrical and software architecture system that Stellantis dubbed STLA Brain. On top of the Brain, Stellantis would add a “STLA SmartCockpit,” a platform to deliver applications to the driver, such as navigation, voice assistance, an e-commerce marketplace, and payment services, as well as applications that would deliver personalized in-vehicle experiences for the driver and passengers. A third piece involved an automated driving platform called “AutoDrive,” developed with BMW. Amazon wastapped to help Stellantiswith the STLA SmartCockpit, specifically with technology that would adapt to customers’ behaviors and interests and then deliver personalized services. Stellantis told TechCrunch it is sticking with its smart cockpit platform. Now it seems Google’s Android-based system, which is used by numerous automakers, is headed to this future software platform.

Over the next few days, TechCrunch reporters will be on the ground giving you the latest announcements and product reveals from Samsung, Nvidia, Toyota, Sony, and more. AI will presumably be the focal point of most company’s presentations, with everything from smart home upgrades to details about the hardware powering AI in consumer devices expected to be covered extensively through the event. Beyond AI, robotics and transportation remain at the core of CES, and we may see some surprises on the show floor after the initial run of major company reveals. Follow our live updates as we share all the reveals and new hardware as it happens. As CES comes to a close, let’s take a look back at all the big announcements and reveals we’ve seen throughout the conference. Press day started off strong with announcements fromNvidia,Samsung, andToyota. We saw some weird and innovative gadgets on the show floor likea fun stringless electric instrumentthat certainly won’t replace guitars anytime soon, a security systemthat shoots paintballs at intruders, and some superfun form factors from Lenovo.We sawa real autonomous vehicle momentmanifest this year — and eventook a ride in a Zoox robotaxi. We’ll continue to have more coverage over the weekend, so stay tuned as the show wraps up! Industry watchers have for years claimed that CES has turned into an auto show, maybe even the most important auto show of the year. But TechCrunch’s Kirsten Korosec couldn’t help but notice thatnot one American automaker could be foundat this year’s event, unless you count VW Group’sU.S. spinoff Scout Motors.Several Chinese automakers filled that void, notably Zeekr, the EV brand owned by China’s Geely Holdings. What’s the reasoning behind their absence? Well, it could be attributed to the normal product cycle, which in the automotive industry tends to be much longer than other consumer electronics. Regardless, walking the floor of West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center — where virtually all vehicle tech can be found — the lack of U.S. automakers is certainly notable. Spend enough time in the Las Vegas Convention Center and you’ll run into the most interesting people. For instance, while I was checking out the Waymo booth I saw none other than Kyle Vogt, the co-founder and former CEO of Cruise who launched a new robot company last yearcalled the Bot Company.Vogt told me he always enjoys discovering new and interesting startups at CES. Take notice startup founders: you never know who might be looking at your tech. I also heard from a few folks that Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe and Wassym Bensaid, who heads up software development, were spotted walking around the show.

The most capable of the models in the new family, called Flux.1 Kontext, can be prompted with text and, optionally, a reference image to create new images, writes Black Forest Labs in ablog post. “The Flux.1 Kontext models deliver state-of-the-art image generation results with strong prompt following, photorealistic rendering, and competitive typography — all at inference speeds up to 8x faster than current leading models,” the company writes in its post. Flux.1 Kontext comes as the race to build competitive image generators heats up. Google debuted its latest image-generating model,Imagen 4, earlier this month at the company’s I/O developer conference. Earlier this year, OpenAI brought avastly improvedimage-generating model to ChatGPT — a model that quickly went viral for its ability to create art in the style of Studio Ghibli movies. Today we're releasing FLUX.1 Kontext – a suite of generative flow matching models that allow you to generate and edit images.Unlike traditional text-to-image models, Kontext understands both text AND images as input, enabling true in-context generation and editing.pic.twitter.com/zleJGuXDge There are two models in the Flux.1 Kontext family: Flux.1 Kontex [pro] and Flux.1 Kontex [max]. The former allows users to generate an image and refine it through multiple “turns,” all while preserving the characters and styles in the images. Flux.1 Kontex [max] focuses on speed, consistency, and adherence to prompts. Hello FLUX.1 Kontext!Kontext is a new state-of-the-art image editing model from Black Forest Labs.

It just works 🔥Pro and Max:…pic.twitter.com/e5URxFewki Unlike some of Black Forest Labs’ previous models, Flux.1 Kontex [pro] and Flux.1 Kontex [max] can’t be downloaded for offline use. However, Black Forest Labs is making an “open” Kontext model, Flux.1 Kontext [dev], available in private beta for research and safety testing. Black Forest Labs is also launching a model playground that allows users to try its models without having to sign up for a third-party service. New users get 200 credits, enough to generate around 12 images with Flux.1 Kontex [pro]. Black Forest Labs, based in Germany, wassaid to be in talksto raise $100 million at a $1 billion valuation toward the end of last year. Many of the founders hail from Stability AI, the creator of the notorious Stable Diffusion image-generating model. Backers include Andreessen Horowitz, Oculus co-founder Brendan Iribe, and Y Combinator’s Garry Tan.

Adobe has noted that the new Galaxy S25 line will be the first handsetsto support the Content Credentials standard,aimed at labeling AI-generated content. The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) group — of which Samsung is now officially a part — describes the standard as a “nutrition label for digital content.” The information presented includes how the content was generated and edited, as well as whether any generative AI technologies were used in the process. Samsung unveiled how SmartThings, its smart home platform, will introduce AI features that allow users to simplify their everyday life through ambient sensing technology and generative AI. By using advanced sensor technology and sound sensor devices in users’ homes, Samsung says it will be able to understand their daily activities and create the ideal environment. For example, SmartThings could detect if a user is exercising and coach the person on their form, or turn on an air purifier after sensing the person’s dog jumping onto the couch. There’s more to come fromSamsung Unpacked. Stay up to date with the latest announcementsright here. Google is introducing a slew of Android updates, including key updates to its AI assistant, Gemini. Userscan now access an improved Geminithat can perform multiple actions across different apps with just a single prompt. For instance, if you’re looking for a restaurant nearby and want to share the options with someone, Gemini can utilize Google Maps to generate recommendations and then compose a message to send via Google Messages. Additionally, Samsung introduced new features for Gemini Live, like the ability to practice a presentation while receiving immediate spoken feedback, as well as uploading files into the conversation, making Gemini Live more multimodal and context-aware. Google announced a pair of accessibility improvements for Androidduring Samsung’s Unpacked 2025, including improvements to the screen reader and improved hearing aid functionality. Wednesday’s updates bring LE Bluetooth compatibility, which delivers features like hands-free calling and lower latency connections. People who use braille will be able to access HID (human interface design), which will “make it easier to use a braille display across operating systems and different types of hardware.” For more reveals out ofSamsung Unpacked, stay up to date with the stream below. Googleis updating Circle to Searchto make it easier for users to find information and get things done. The feature allows people to search from anywhere on their phone by using gestures like circling, highlighting, scribbling, or tapping. Google is now expanding AI Overviews to more kinds of visual results for places, trending images, unique objects, and more with Circle to Search. If you’re at a museum and see an interesting piece of art, for example, you can circle it to get an AI snapshot of helpful information about the piece. Google says Circle to Search will also be able to recognize numbers, email addresses, and URLs you see on your screen. Samsung announceda small but meaningful tweak to the side buttonforthe Galaxy S25 line. As it continues to focus more efforts on mobile AI, Samsung is making it easier to access Google Gemini with the press of a button. Gemini can now be activated with a long press of the device’s side button, signaling the end days of quick Home and Bixby access. Watch the full Samsung Unpacked eventat the link below.

360,Rivr’s dog-like robots join Veho vans to solve ‘last-100-yards’ parcel delivery in Austin,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Most delivery automation stops at the curb. But forVehoand Zurich-based robotics startup Rivr, the real challenge — and opportunity — lies in those final 100 yards from van to doorstep. In a pilot program launching Tuesday in Austin, Rivr’s four-wheeled, stair-climbing delivery robot, which CEO and founder Marko Bjelonic describes as “a dog on roller skates,” will ferry packages from Veho’s vans directly to customers’ front doors. The companies are starting small, they told TechCrunch exclusively. Just one highly supervised robot will work daily, making five- to six-hour runs over the span of a couple weeks throughout Austin. But both companies see it as a critical step toward solving a unique slice of the end-to-end autonomous delivery journey. Bjelonic says in last-mile delivery, “robotics makes an impact by actually solving these very challenging problems that are actually quite easy for humans but hard for robots. And we see [Rivr] as a differentiator, almost as the next evolutionary step from the sidewalk robots.” The partnership with Veho also gives Rivr an opportunity to both test its technology and accumulate data necessary to build a general physical AI framework. “What we have seen in the robotic space is that there’s a data barrier, because ChatGPT and other chatbots have the internet as training data, and autonomous cars have thousands of cars on the street that they can attach sensors to and start collecting data,” Bjelonic told TechCrunch. “But in the robotics world, that kind of dataset is missing, so you need to find the meaningful use case where you can solve a real problem, and then you can start collecting all of the data to make these robots more intelligent.” For Veho, which delivers across 50 U.S. markets for brands like Sephora, Saks, HelloFresh, and more, this partnership is a chance to test what automation looks like from the van to the customer’s door. That could eventually allow for more deliveries to take place at once, particularly in dense urban areas where both the driver and the robot can tag-team a particular street simultaneously. Bjelonic says Rivr’s “robot helpers” can also “reduce the workload on these drivers” by taking over the physically demanding task of walking door to door. During the Austin trial, a Rivr employee will accompany the bot to ensure safety and delivery quality. Bjelonic told TechCrunch the bots can operate autonomously, but remote operators will be able to tap in if they get stuck. The Austin pilot will start in the more residential area of Northwest Austin before expanding to denser areas of town, according to Fred Cook, Veho’s co-founder and CTO. In the future, Cook says he could imagine pairing the vehicles with certain types of vehicles with charging stations for the bots to keep them going for a full day of work. Rivr hopes to use the learnings from its partnership with Veho to scale to 100 bots by next year and thousands in 2027. The startup is currently operating in the U.K. through a partnership with delivery platform Evri. Rivr has raised more than $25 million, including from a Jeff Bezos-led round thatvalued the company at $100 million.

362,Apple’s US App Store topped $400B in developer billings and sales in 2024,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Just ahead of its Worldwide Developers Conference next month, Apple on Thursdayannouncednew figures related to the U.S. App Store’s financial success. The company says its U.S. App Store ecosystem has generated $406 billion in developer billings and sales in 2024 — a figure that’s nearly tripled in size since 2019, when it then generated $142 billion. Apple also made a point to note that, for 90% of the billings and sales facilitated by the App Store, developers paid no commission. The new figures come from an Apple-funded study conducted by Professor Andrey Fradkin from Boston University Questrom School of Business and economist Dr. Jessica Burley from Analysis Group. Analysis Group has beenworking with Apple for yearsamid growing antitrust scrutiny to create reports and studies that showcase the App Store’s market power in a more favorable light and as a net positive for developers. In particular, these studies have stressed that only a small sliver of Apple’s developer base even pays Apple commissions, and the majority of those who do so are on a Small Business plan or other programs where their commission is reduced from the standard 30% to 15%. However, those findings haven’t protected Apple from being forced to open up the App Store to increased competition in the U.S. Last month, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogersruled that Apple had violated the court’s order arising from Fortnite maker Epic Games’ lawsuitthat had required Apple to reform its App Store’s policy around external payments. As a result of that ruling, Apple was forced to letdevelopers add links to their app that point to web payment options, where Apple is not allowed to take a commission. Apple is now in the processof appealingthe ruling. The years-long fight over App Store commissions has led to increased hostility and disappointment from members of the iOS developer community,who believe thattheir applications are part of the reason for the iPhone’s historical success. Many feel they should be treated with more gratitude for their efforts, and not as a resource to extract money from. Apple, on the other hand, staunchly believes that the App Store itself is the reason for the developers’ success, as it provides the marketplace that allows consumers to discover new apps and easily pay for the developers’ software and services. That comes through in Apple’s latest report as well, where Apple notes that earnings for U.S.-based developers have more than doubled over the last five years, while small business developers have seen earnings increase by 76% from 2021 to 2024. (The latter number is not surprising. In 2020,Apple launched its Small Business Programthat reduced commissions for developers making less than $1 million per year. An earnings increase is to be expected.) Apple also reminds U.S. developers that its App Store allows them to reach a global market of 175 countries and regions, and itprevents billions in fraudulent transactions. Its developer investments include 250,000 APIs,  as part of frameworks like HealthKit, Metal, Core ML, MapKit, and SwiftUI. Additionally, the new report highlights how much developers are making from the App Store in areas where they don’t have to pay commission. For instance, Apple says that last year, the U.S. App Store ecosystem facilitated $277 billion in total billings and sales from physical goods and services, $75 billion from in-app advertising, and $53 billion from digital goods and services. It also notes that, since 2019, spending on physical goods and services more than tripled and in-app spending on digital goods and services and in-app advertising more than doubled. General retail spending and grocery delivery increased more than fourfold. Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

And it looks like the company is resorting to unconventional storage sites for the excess vehicles. One such location, perCrains Detroit Business, is a Detroit shopping center that is now in violation of city code for storing dozens of Cybertrucks and other unsold Teslas in its parking lot. No doubt the parking lot looks like a dystopian graveyard with rows upon rows of shiny silver Cybertrucks taking up space where shoppers once came to visit the now-closed Bed Bath & Beyond and Torrid. The Buffalo Wild Wings in the shopping center, though, is still open. The lot is near a new Tesla showroom in West Bloomfield, which may account for the overflow. Crain’s reports that the shopping center landlord has been informed of the violation, but enforcement could take some time. While stilloutselling other electric trucks, Tesla’s Cybertruck has underperformed CEO Elon Musk’shopes for its successaftereight recallswithin a year and the automaker’sbrand devaluationdue to Musk’s political involvement.

The company said ina filing with Maine’s attorney generalthat the breach, dating back to December 25, 2024, allowed a hacker to obtain consumers’ sensitive personal data from a third-party platform used by the company for software development. Jennifer Richman, a spokesperson for LexisNexis, told TechCrunch that an unknown hacker accessed the company’s GitHub account. The stolen data varies, but includes names, dates of birth, phone numbers, postal and email addresses, Social Security numbers, and driver license numbers. It’s not immediately clear what circumstances led to the breach. Richman said LexisNexis received a report on April 1, 2025 “from an unknown third party claiming to have accessed certain information.” The company would not say if it had received a ransom demand from the hacker. Data brokers like LexisNexis are part of a billion-dollar industry of companies that profit from collecting and selling access to large amounts of Americans’ personal and financial data. LexisNexis uses swathes of consumer information to help companies detect potentially fraudulent transactions, as well as to perform risk assessment and due diligence on would-be customers. Last year,The New York Timesreported that car manufacturers were among several companies that shared data on vehicle driving habits with LexisNexis without car owners’ explicit permission. The data was then sold on to insurance companies, which used the mileage and driving data to determine the drivers’ insurance premiums. Law enforcement agencies also use LexisNexis for obtaining personal information on suspects, such asnames, home addresses, and call records. Earlier this month, the Trump administration scrapped a plan that would haverestricted data brokers from selling Americans’ personal and financial information, including Social Security numbers. White House official Russell Vought wrote in a Federal Register notice that the Biden-era rule, which would have required data brokers to follow the same federal privacy rules as credit bureaus and renter-screening companies, was “not necessary or appropriate,” despite long-standing calls by privacy advocates to close the loophole.

Limited partners in the fund include Citi Impact Fund, M&T Bank, Wells Fargo, and Spelman College. It hopes to invest in at least 25 early-stage companies, writing check sizes between $1 million and $2.3 million, with 50% of the fund reserved for follow-on investments. Speaking to TechCrunch, Nasir Qadree,founder and managing partner of Zeal,said Fund II will focus on financial technology, healthcare, and future of work, as its other fund did. It has already invested in at least five companies, including the maternal health platform Seven Starling and the fintech Debbie. Qadree described the funding environment for Fund II as “undoubtedly challenging” because of macroeconomic uncertainty, LP rebalancing, and tighter allocation windows. “But these headwinds also sharpened our strategy and reaffirmed the strength of our approach,” Qadree said. “I’m proud to share that over 80% of our limited partners from Zeal Fund I continued with us into Fund II, a signal of deep conviction in our ability to consistently back category-defining companies.” Black-led and founded funds such as this have been making some sizeable closes lately. Slauson & Co.announced a $100 millionFund II last September, followed by Illumen Capital, founded by Daryn Dodson, announcing theraise of a $32.75 millionfund in November. This year, Sydney Thomas’ Symphonic Capital announced theraise of a $13.5 millioninaugural fund, while Cherryrock Capital, founded by Stacy Brown-Philpot, announced theraise of its $172 millionFund I. Some of these funds are general in their mission, while others are more explicit in their target of underrepresented communities, showing that appetite still exists for such funds, despite the pressure from the current U.S. presidential administration, and among those that support it, against anything that could be considered “DEI.” Overall, Zeal, a more generalist fund founded in 2019, has invested in 40 companies.

370,Rocket Lab backer Outset raises $25M to fund New Zealand’s deep tech moonshots,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us New Zealand’s deep tech ambitions just got a $25 million boost. Outset Ventures, the Auckland-based venture firm and incubator that spun out unicorns like Rocket Lab and LanzaTech, has closed its second fund at an oversubscribed $41.5 million NZD. The fund’s mission is to back startups working on hard science and engineering breakthroughs — technologies its partners believeNew Zealand is uniquely suited to lead. That includes everything from aerospace to medical technology, though Outset is especially focused on energy generation and storage. The firm is betting that New Zealand, while too small to play on the frontlines of AI, can tackle the downstream energy and infrastructure problems that AI is already starting to strain. “We know that the biggest constraint for AI growth all comes down to who can get the most installed energy the fastest, and so that’s where we’ve ended up concentrating more of our attention,” Angus Blair, partner at Outset, told TechCrunch. Many of the startups in Outset’s cohort focus on delivering cheaper, cleaner ways to generate and store energy, recycle heat waste, and address infrastructure bottlenecks that AI is already straining, per Blair. One emerging Kiwi leader has beenOpenStar, a nuclear fusion startup that’s working on levitated dipole reactors, and is one of the few from Outset’s Fund I cohort to also receive funding from Fund II. The firm reached animportant milestone last Novemberwhen it created superheated plasma at temperatures of around 540,000 degrees Fahrenheit — an important step toward producing fusion energy, and one that took only around $10 million to get there as compared to many decades-long government-led initiatives in the fusion space. Then there’sEnergyBank, which is building long-duration energy storage for floated offshore wind that’s best suited for deeper waters. Blair said the firm’s solution is a perfect complement to the many plans to installmore floating offshore wind farmsin regions like the North Sea. “If you can firm that power, that power is worth a lot more, and so adding that long-duration energy storage can increase the profitability of those assets by about 50%,” Blair said. “It also [helps] power data centers and the rest of the grid, particularly in Europe, which is struggling with grid resiliency.” OpenStar and EnergyBank are just two examples of the kind of moonshot bets Outset is aiming to scale globally. Where Fund I validated deep tech as a viable path for Kiwi startups, Fund II is positioning Outset as a launchpad for companies with hard science at their core and massive international ambition. Part of that mission is backed by the firm’s 60,000-square-foot facility in Auckland, which gives portfolio companies access to lab and engineering gear that’s otherwise hard to come by. In a country where early-stage capital and technical facilities can be limited, this kind of vertical integration is a key part of how Outset de-risks deep tech. And while the fund’s $25 million might sound modest by Silicon Valley standards, Blair says it’s well-sized for New Zealand’s tight-knit ecosystem. “We’ve got really capital efficient businesses down here, and so it goes a remarkably long way,” Blair said. The country’s startup funding environment has alwaysleaned toward capital efficiencyand high technical quality over blitzscaling. In 2023, venture investment in New Zealand declined amid inflation, global economic uncertainty, and reduced appetite from more cautious offshore investors. But2024 saw a rebound, with venture and early-stage investment reaching $350 million ($587.6 million NZD) — a record high and a 53% jump from 2023. Outset’s own LP mix reflects this dynamic: About two-thirds of Fund II comes from local institutional and private sources, while the rest is from international high-net-worth individuals, many of whom have relocated to New Zealand later in their careers and are investing in its future. And even though Kiwi startups have drawn interest over the past few years from heavy-hitting global firms like Bessemer, DCVC, Founders Fund, and Khosla Ventures, that kind of international capital remains hard-won. Distance and a smaller local investor base make it more difficult for New Zealand startups to break into global capital networks early, even though access to those networks is essential for scaling. Despite its distance and small size, Blair argues New Zealand is well-positioned to tackle some of the world’s greatest challenges — and deep tech is where the country already has a track record. “It’s where our biggest wins in the venture-backed space have come from historically,” Blair said. “So founders and VCs feel they have a lot more license to go and take these big moonshot swings in these really technical domains.” Topics Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk’s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

Humain is in talks with U.S. firms like Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI, and Elon Musk’s xAI about its plans and is also exploring a deal with U.S. companies to sell an equity stake in its data center business, the report said. Amin did not reveal which companies these are but said some are “massive names in the data center segment,” according to the report. Humain was launched earlier this month ahead of a visit by U.S. president Donald Trump and several tech industry allies. Under anew Trump administration initiative, U.S. tech suppliers, including Nvidia and AMD, have been allowed to arrange deals with Saudi Arabian firms. So far, Humain has struck deals with Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, andAmazonand plans to have 1.9 gigawatts of data center capacity by 2030. The plan is to process 7% of global AI training and inferencing by 2030, and the endeavor is expected to cost about $77 billion, the FT quoted Amin as saying.

372,"Meet LoveJack, the dating app designed for users to find love using just five words","Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us As Kevin Malone from “The Office”once said, “Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?” For Julia LeStage and Lisa Le, the creators of a new dating app calledLoveJack, finding love online doesn’t have to feel like filling out a mountain of paperwork. Sometimes, all you need are a few carefully chosen words to spark a connection. LoveJack profiles look like those on other blind-dating apps, but with a twist. Instead of blurred or hidden profiles, users see five words chosen by potential matches. When users press and hold on their phone screens (the app doesn’t use swiping mechanics), profile pictures are then revealed. The five words can be anything from personal traits and jokes to current feelings or even random details, such as the ingredients in their lunch sandwich — an entertaining tactic that we saw one beta user try during our testing. The idea is that the five-word constraint allows users to be creative while also challenging them to be concise and clever, encouraging more witty conversations and moving away from mundane questions like “What do you do for a living?” or overused pickup lines. LeStage and Le decided to create LoveJack after being frustrated with the way online dating profiles often resemble job resumes — complete with posed photos, filters, and carefully crafted bios that can feel exaggerated. “This is not LinkedIn. Where has the fun gone?” LeStage told TechCrunch, reflecting a sentiment shared bymany online daters, which may explain why dating giants likeTinderhave faced challenges in recent quarters. LeStage got the idea while working as a judge for the Webby Awards, which notoriously limits winners to five-word speeches. The app also takes inspiration from The New York Times’popular Wordle game. She shared with us that when she re-entered the dating scene, apps sucked the fun out of the experience, noting that traditional platforms emphasize superficial judgments based on appearance. So she decided to use the five-word challenge on her dates to spice things up, which helped her realize that people tended to use words that “advertised” their way of thinking. “It’s the stories behind the words that matter,” LeStage explained. For instance, she spoke with someone who mentioned the word “disco.” When she asked him more about it, she discovered that he had written about the history of disco. “I was like, ‘Well, aren’t you Mr. Interesting?’” she said. Other standout features include the options to either “Bet On” or “Hold” a match. Betting is similar to liking a profile, but the key difference is that users must place a bet by entering a five-word opening line. This gives the match something interesting to respond to. Users are limited to a maximum of five matches per day, so they need to be strategic in their choices. This is where LoveJack’s “Hold” feature comes into play, allowing users to bookmark a profile if they’re unsure about someone. Additionally, the five-word descriptions can be updated every day, adding a social aspect to the app. LoveJack archives all previous entries, allowing users to scroll through everything they’ve written. “You can see in real time, day to day, how they’re revealing themselves through their five-word updates…Your story is going to change every day, all day, like your mood and the weather,” LeStage added. In the future, there will also be a premium subscription that will include an “All In” button, the app’s version of a “Super Like,” but in this case, it’ll use all five bets on one person so they can’t match with anyone else for the rest of the day. When it comes to unmatching someone, LoveJack says it tries to minimize ghosting by requiring users to write a preset message when they set up their profiles. The goodbye note is automatically sent to anyone they unmatch. Another interesting aspect of LoveJack profiles is that users are encouraged to use fake names to protect their identities. While using pseudonyms on dating platforms is common, it can elicit mixed reactions from users. Some individuals may question the authenticity of potential matches, while others might prefer to keep their personal details private until they become more familiar with the other person. LoveJack states that it implements a selfie verification process to confirm that the person behind the profile is indeed who they claim to be. Other safety features include reporting and blocking capabilities, as well as censorship of banned language and explicit photos, and an emergency feature that enables users to contact the police and safety hotlines. (These features were unavailable during our beta testing but are expected to be included in the official version.) LoveJack is set to launch its iOS app next month. It’ll launch in London first, with plans to roll out to U.S. markets next, including Boston, New York, San Francisco, and others. An Android version of the app will launch in India in late summer.

The company announced a pair of open source robots, HopeJR and Reachy Mini. HopeJR is a full-size humanoid robot that has 66 actuated degrees of freedom, or 66 independent movements, including the ability to walk and move its arms. Reachy Mini is a desktop unit that can move its head, talk, listen, and be used to test AI apps. Meet HopeJr, a full humanoid robot lowering the barrier to entry!Capable of walking, manipulating many objects, open-source and costs under $3000 🤯Designed by@therobotstudioand@huggingface👇pic.twitter.com/wCwo8YPOGV Hugging Face doesn’t have an exact timeline for shipping these robots. The company’s co-founder and CEO, Clem Delangue, told TechCrunch over email that they expect to start shipping at least the first few units by the end of the year, and the waitlist is currently open. Hugging Face estimates that the HopeJR will cost around $3,000 per unit and the Reachy Mini will cost around $250 to $300, depending on tariffs. “The important aspect is that these robots are open source, so anyone can assemble, rebuild, [and] understand how they work, and [that they’re] affordable, so that robotics doesn’t get dominated by just a few big players with dangerous black-box systems,” Delangue said via email. This robot release was made possible in part by the company’s acquisition of humanoid robotics startupPollen Robotics, which was announced in April, according to Delangue. He added that the Pollen team gave Hugging Face “new capabilities” required to make these bots. Hugging Face has been making a concerted push into the robotics industry over the past few years. It launchedLeRobot, a collection of open AI models, datasets, and tools to build robotics systems, in 2024. So far in 2025, the company has released an updated version of its 3D-printed and programmable robotic arm,the SO-101, which the company built in a partnership with French robotics firm The Robot Studio. It alsoexpanded the training data on its LeRobot platform, through a partnership with AI startup Yaak, to include training data for self-driving machines.

Perplexity Labs is available on the web, iOS, and Android, and coming soon to Perplexity’s apps for Mac and Windows. “Perplexity Labs can help you complete a variety of work and personal projects,” Perplexityexplainsin a blog post. “Labs is designed to invest more time — 10 minutes or longer — and leverage additional tools [to accomplish tasks], such as advanced file generation and mini-app creation.” Labs, which arrives the same day as viral AI agent platformManusreleased a slide deck creation tool, is a part of Perplexity’s effort to broaden beyond its core business of search. Perplexity is currently previewing a web browser,Comet, and recently acquiredRead.vc, a social media network for professionals. Perplexity Labs, powered by AI, can conduct research and analysis, taking around 10 minutes and using tools like web search, code execution, and chart and image creation to craft reports and visualizations. Labs can create interactive web apps, Perplexity says, and write code to structure data, apply formulas, and create documents. All files created during a Perplexity Labs workflow — such as charts, images, and code files — are organized in a tab from where they can be viewed or downloaded. “This expanded capability empowers you to develop a broader array of deliverables for your projects,” according to Perplexity’s blog post. It all sounds good in theory, but AI being an imperfect technology, Labs likely doesn’t always hit the mark. Of course, we’ll reserve judgment until we have a chance to test it. Perplexity has increasingly invested in corporate-focused functionality, last summerlaunchingan enterprise plan with user management, “internal knowledge search,” and more. The moves could be in part at the behest of the VCs backing Perplexity, who are no doubt eager to see a return sooner than later. Perplexity isreportedlyin talks to raise up to $1 billion in capital from investors at an $18 billion valuation.

376,Tinder tests letting users set a ‘height preference’,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Tinder is leaning into dating apps’ reputation for superficiality with the launch of a new feature that lets paid subscribers add their height preferences to their profiles. After a Reddit userposted a photoof the new height setting in the Tinder app, a company spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the discovery setting has been launched as a global test. Tinder Gold and Premium subscribers in the test group will have access to the feature, but not free users, we’re told. In addition, the setting will indicate a preference, rather than functioning as a “hard filter,” the company says. That means it won’t actually block or exclude profiles but instead inform recommendations. “We’re always listening to what matters most to our Tinder users — and testing the paid height preference is a great example of how we’re building with urgency, clarity, and focus,” said Phil Price Fry, VP Comms at Tinder, in an emailed statement. “This is part of a broader effort to help people connect more intentionally on Tinder. Our new product principles guide every decision, and this one speaks directly to a few: prioritizing user outcomes, moving fast, and learning quickly. Not every test becomes a permanent feature, but every test helps us learn how we can deliver smarter, more relevant experiences and push the category forward.” While typically dating apps let users filter for people by more traditional concerns, like someone’s age or whether they want a long-term relationship or kids, the height setting is likely to cause more controversy and concern. Since the rise of online dating, a focus on someone’s physicality — like their looks or size — has become a primary factor in determining who’s worth a match. Tinder helped accelerate this trend thanks to its user interface, which puts a heavy emphasis on looking through people’s photos. Other Tinder users often quickly react to those photos with left or right swipes to indicate interest. In addition to exposing people’s preferences for the conventionally attractive, dating apps’ popularity led to a culture where abias toward taller menbecame the norm. It’snot uncommon to come across profileswhere women state they’re only looking for matches who are at least 6 feet tall, for instance — even if in real life they’d be more flexible about this requirement. Tinder has even poked fun at this trend in previous years, like when it made an April Fools’ Dayannouncementthat it wouldintroducea “height verification” feature in its app. (Many mendidn’t findthis particular joke funny.) The height bias has also been the subject of other parodies, like whendesigner Soren Iverson imagineda version of Tinder that let men override users’ height requirements for a fee. The company may hope that the addition of a height setting could encourage more women to use and pay for the app, which tends to be more heavilydominated by men both in the U.S.andinternationally. The test’s launch follows Tinder parent Match’s recent earnings, whichrevealed a 5% fall in paying users. Paid subscribers across Match’s dating apps fell to 14.2 million in the first quarter, down from 14.9 million users a year ago. The company is in the middle ofanother CEO transition, with Match CEO Spencer Rascoff set to run Tinder too later this summer.

377,Tesla pleads for Senate to spare its booming energy business,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Tesla is a business built, in part, on government regulations and incentives, from a Department of Energyloan guaranteein 2009 to the regulatory credits it sells to other automakers, which have drivena thirdof its $32 billion in profits since 2012. Now, the company’s energy business — a rarebright spotamidfaltering demandfor its EVs — is under assault. House Republicans passed a reconciliation bill last week that would undo much of the Inflation Reduction Act, including tax credits for residential solar installations and for clean energy projects. That bill is now before the Senate. If the Senate were to pass it with those repeals in tact, it could have a devastating impact on Tesla’s energy division, which brought in $2.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter, a 67% increase year-over-year. With CEOElon Muskclaiming that his time in government has come to an end, Tesla has taken to lobbying legislators on X. There, Tesla Energyappealedto Senate Republicans. “Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid – we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down of 25D and 48e,” Tesla posted on X. “This will ensure continued speedy deployment of over 60 GW capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth.” Today, homeowners qualify for 30% tax credits on new solar installations, while clean energy developers can generally claim the same. Those provisions are currently scheduled to sunset at the end of 2032, but House Republicans want to end the credits four years earlier and require projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage. Cutting those parts of the law could risk the deployment of 60 gigawatts of capacity annually “to support AI and domestic manufacturing support,” Tesla said. The Trump administration has made “energy dominance” a key priority, and slowing the deployment of renewable and clean energy puts that goal at risk. Last year,93%of all new generating capacity in the U.S. was clean energy, mostly solar and grid-scale storage. In the first quarter this year, renewables added 7.4 gigawatts, the second best Q1 ever. Queues for new natural gas turbines stretch for years, while solar farms can generally be completed in 18 months. Like many residential solar installers, Tesla’s energy business is heavily dependent on tax incentives. Since Republicans have prioritized repealing the Inflation Reduction Act, American solar stocks have taken a beating. This year, Enphase is down 45%, Sunrun has lost a quarter of its share price, and First Solar is off 15%.

It’s time to close up the live updates shop. Yes, there was a lot announced today, although many could be housed under the “AI improvements” category. You can read everything that wasannounced at Google I/O 2025here. The mood was upbeat and the crowd — per reporter Maxwell Zeff’s view — was most interested in the AI Mode rollout. What’s AI Mode?You can read about it here.Here’s what is on tap for tomorrow. Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov is scheduled to talk. No word on what Dolgov will talk about but he’ll surely mention this milestone that was posted on X today: Waymo has now officially served over 10 million fully autonomous paid rides — doubling its total from the end oflast year. Tomorrow’s I/O agenda is packed, including sessions covering Google’sGemma family of open AI models,Google Workspace, and Android development tools. We’re expecting lots of demos, as well as possibly a few surprises that weren’t announced during the Tuesday keynotes. Googlelaunched a new series of AI modelsin its Gemma collection at Google I/O. Gemma models are “open” in the sense that developers can build apps on top of them and fine-tune them, including offline. Gemma 3n is a general-purpose model that can handle audio, text, images, and videos, and run on devices with as little as 2GB of RAM. MedGemma can analyze health-related text and images. As for SignGemma, it can translate sign language to spoken-language text; Google says it’s best at American Sign Language and English. Consumer features might’ve gotten most of the focus at Google I/O’s day-one keynote, but Google highlighted a few developer tools and platform updates as well. Google’s Colab, a notebooking tool for AI applications, now has a built-in AI “agent” that can perform certain actions, like fixing errors and transforming code. Meanwhile, Gemini Code Assist, Google’s AI coding assistant, entered general availability. And Google rolled out a new API, Computer Use API, that lets developers build applications that can browse the web or use other software tools. Google says that it’s teaming up with Darren Aronofsky, the filmmaker behind “The Whale” and “The Fountain,” to experiment with generative AI tools for movie making. We’re teaming up with@PrimordialSoup_, a new venture by visionary director@DarrenAronofsky, to redefine AI’s role in filmmaking and put artists in control of technological innovation.The first film explores how emotional live-action performance integrates with Veo-generated…pic.twitter.com/IjWTOuUdvb Aronofsky’s new venture, Primordial Soup, has produced a live-action film that integrates footage generated byGoogle’s Veo video model. The film, “Ancestra,” was directed by Eliza McNitt and will premiere at the Tribeca Festival in June. During the Google I/O keynote this morning, Google CEO Sundar Pichai mentioned that AI usage across Google’s products and services climbed from 9.7 trillion tokens in April 2024 to more than 480 trillion tokens in April 2025, a 50x increase. Most important plot from IO today — AI usage is skyrocketing. This is real.pic.twitter.com/IGQf3UX50k Tokens are the raw bits of data that AI models work with, with a million tokens being equivalent to about 750,000 words (roughly 163,000 words longer than “War and Peace”). Two hours. Yes, two hours to try the Android-based XR glasses at Google I/O 2025, at least that is according to boots-on-the-ground reporter Maxwell Zeff. In case you missed it, we have thefull story on the XR glasses, which is Google going after Meta’s Ray-Ban Meta glasses. Google launched the Android XR platform withQualcomm and Samsung last year. Today, the company provided more detail, had a few live demos, and announced new partnerships with Gentle Monster and Warby Parker to create smart glasses based on Android XR. The update to Wear OS 6 is, perhaps, one of the announcements you might have missed. The upshot: Google gave Wear OS 6 a design makeover with Material 3 Expressive, the design language the company unveiled earlier this month. Reporter Ivan Mehta has thedetails in this story,but here’s the TL;DR: Google released the developer preview of Wear OS 6, which is based on Android 16, for testing. The aim of the makeover is to make apps look more cohesive, so app tiles will adopt the default system font, among other improvements. Word from folks “in the know” is that Waymo has a booth at the Google I/O 2025 conference and is giving out tickets to ride in the company’s robotaxis in its Silicon Valley territory. Waymo just received approval from California regulators that allows them toexpand that service area. The expansion hasn’t happened yet, but it does allow Waymo to offer robotaxi rides in more Silicon Valley cities, including most of San Jose. Here’s another item you might have missed. App developers who build for Google’s TV platform, Google TV, can now use an updated version of the In-App Ratings and Reviews API to prompt viewers to leave a rating and review for a piece of content, like a TV show or movie. The feature allows users to see the rating averages, browse reviews, and leave their own reviews directly from the app store listing page on Google TV. There was so much packed into the Google I/O 2025 keynote that we missed a few items. For instance, toward the end of the keynote, Sundar Pichai said Google is building a constellation of satellites to detect natural calamities. “Together with an amazing group of partners, we are building something called Fire SAT. It’s a constellation of satellites that use multi-spectral satellite imagery and AI, aiming to provide near-real-time insights,” he said. “It can detect fires as small as 270 square feet, about the size of a one-car garage. Our first satellite is in orbit now, and when fully operational, imagery will be updated with a much greater frequency, down from every 12 hours today to every 20 minutes.” The main showcase of the Google I/O conference — which was livestreamed — is over. CEO Sundar Pichai gave closing remarks for the show, along with a handy wrap-up video. But stay with us for a bit. We’ll have more to share, plus full articles on everything that was announced today. In a word: AI. But it goes deeper than that. AI is touching all of Google’s products, from search and video to Google Meet and its Gemini AI app.  Google’s in on the joke. Toward the end of this year’s I/O keynote, the company put up a counter showing how many times its execs and product leaders mentioned “AI” onstage. “AI” got 92 callouts this year — a little down from I/O 2024’s 120+ mentions.

379,"A decade in, bootstrapped Thinkst Canary reaches $20M in ARR without VC funding","Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us This month, cybersecurity company Thinkst will mark its 10th anniversary since the launch of its now-flagship product, Canary. The company debuted Canary after seeing companies spend millions of dollars on cybersecurity products, yet were still taking months or longer to realize that they had been breached. Thinkstbelieved it could make a digital tripwire product that would catch hackers in the act, and by all accounts, it did just that. Over the past decade, the company has grown to around 40 employees, mostly developers and engineers; hasn’t taken on any outside funding; and is on track this year to make a healthy profit on $20 million in annual recurring revenue,almost double from 2021, Thinkst founder Haroon Meer told TechCrunch. It’s an impressive, if not refreshing feat, at a time when many cybersecurity companies are driven by breakneck growth and speed and fueled by venture capital. Meer, who founded Thinkst and serves as its chief executive from Cape Town in South Africa, told TechCrunch in a call earlier this month that Thinkst made it this far by focusing on its customers and what they need — specifically a product that does what it says it does — and not growing the company at an uncontrolled rate. Meer said this approach is working, pointing to 60% of its first-year customers who are still with the company today. “We’re not artificially holding back growth, but we’re also not doing any of the really silly, ‘pour gasoline on the fire’ growth-at-all-costs stuff,” said Meer. “What you have to do is keep the promises that you make, and you’ll grow into the people that are right for you.” In 2015, Thinkst launched its Canary hardware product — named after acanary in a coal mine, essentially a very early warning system — that can detect and alert when hackers are present on a company’s network. A canary is set up like a honeypot, so that when a malicious hacker (or anauthorized pen-testerstress-testing a company’s defenses) accesses the canary thinking they struck it lucky by accessing a Windows PC with an open file share, or a server packed with customer data, secret API keys, or a vital service for a company’s operations, the canary will send an alert about the breach and allow the company to take immediate action. The canary’s purpose is to reduce the amount of time that hackers have to sneak around on a victim’s network to search for sensitive data, plant malware, or otherwise cause damage before getting caught. The average hacker has around 24 days on a victim’s network before detection, according to Verizon’s most recent annual data breach report. The company also offersCanary Tokens, its free and public offering that lets anyone drop an item of ostensible value, like a password, document, or a credit card number, for example, in a safe place so that when someone accesses or opens the item, you are alerted at the same moment your safe place was compromised. “One of the things we got accidentally lucky with is it’s really hard to deploy a canary wrong,” said Meer. “If you make it fit in, then you catch attackers, and if you make it stick out, you catch attackers.” After all, if a malicious hacker sees an advantage to get what they need faster, they’re going to take the opportunity. “It’s rare for us to have a week without getting an email from a customer saying this saved our lives, or we had a pen test and this is the only thing that caught our attackers,” said Meer. It is these success stories that “fuels” the company, said Meer, and helps drive the company’s organic sales growth. Thinkst does not have an outbound sales team; instead, the company relies largely on word of mouth, or existing customers who want to buy more of the company’s honeypots. Meer said that while Thinkst hasn’t taken any outside funding to date, he does not begrudge the VC industry and values its insights. While conceding that some companies cannot get to where they are without heavy cash injections, he argues that money is “not the gate that stops you from doing stuff.” Meer said that companies focusing on making their products work and their customers happy is core to good business. “My main thing is that you should run the business in a way that you are still attractive for investment or acquisition,” said Meer. “If you build a good enough business so that you don’t need it, you can always ask for it when you do.” Meer was not shy about his company’s ambitions. “We think every company should be running at least five canaries now,” he said. Some companies have a handful of canaries and some into the hundreds or more. “There’s a bunch of stuff that we could do to make more money; we just don’t think that’s necessary right now, because what we’re doing is offering a good product at a fair price, and that’s growing.” “We are $20 million now, but we don’t think $20 million is our ceiling,” said Meer.

Heron Poweris developing solid-state transformers, which promise to be more compact and responsive than the century-old analog models. Transformers are key parts of the electrical grid, stepping voltage up and down as it moves through the system. Heron focuses on so-called medium-voltage transformers, which covers a range of possible applications, from large substations behind fences to the green metal boxes found throughout residential neighborhoods. Heron Powersaid it’s targeting initial installations in early 2027, and it’s partnering with “major energy and data center developers.” Capricorn Investment Group led the round, with participation from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Energy Impact Partners, Gigascale Capital, Powerhouse Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, and former Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn.

382,Founder Sahil Lavingia says he was booted from DOGE after just 55 days,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Sahil Lavingia haspublished a diaryrecounting his time as a member ofElon Musk’s DOGE workforce. It’s a short read — Lavingia’s DOGE stint lasted just 55 days — but it does provide new details on the temporary government organization formed by President Trump’s executive order. Lavingia is a well-known name in Silicon Valley, from his days as an early employee of Pinterest to his current gig as founder ofGumroad,a platform where creators can sell their goods. He’s also awell-known seed and angel investor. He joined DOGE as a software engineer for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in mid-March, he wrote. What stands out from his account is his surprise that the 473,000-employee government agency had strict rules on who could be targeted in a layoff, and he quickly learned that all things at the VA were not as inefficient as he imagined. He also lamented that DOGE itself isn’t a well-oiled machine. As a volunteer who had a salary of $0, he was immediately tasked with identifying “wasteful” contracts and the people the VA should lay off, he wrote. But he was surprised to discover facets like seniority and the person’s veteran status (this was the VA, after all) determined who could be targeted. Performance could be factored in lower on the list, in Lavingia’s view. He also describedDOGE’s advisory roleas like a McKinsey management consultant and said DOGE is not responsible for the actions taken by the orgs. “DOGE had no direct authority. The real decisions came from the agency heads appointed by President Trump, who were wise to let DOGE act as the ‘fall guy’ for unpopular decisions,” he says. This is similar to what Musk was decrying this week to theWashington Post. Musk describedDOGE as Washington, D.C.’s  “whipping boy,”blamed for every unpopular decision. Lavingia said he joined DOGE after campaigning for Bernie Sanders in 2016 because he dreamed of writing code for the government that helped people at scale. Because his DOGE missives didn’t take much time, he said he worked on projects that interested him, including overhauling the UX of the VA’s already-in-use LLM-based chatbot. He said he built a fairly long list of stuff in his less-than-two-month stint but didn’t get a chance to do enormous projects, like “improving the UX of veterans’ filing disability claims or automating/speeding up claims processing.” And, he wrote, “I was never able to get approval to ship anything to production that would actually improve American lives — while also saving money for the American taxpayer.” He was, however, given permission to open source much of his work. His work included a tool that scanned internal PDFs for terms “related to DEI, gender identity, COVID policies, climate initiatives, WHO partnerships,”he describedon the tool’s page, as well as tools that used LLMs to analyze contracts and a tool for building org charts. He also made observations about the lack of organization in DOGE itself. “I wondered why there wasn’t a centralized DOGE software engineering playbook with all of our learnings; overall, I was surprised by the lack of knowledge-sharing within DOGE. It seemed like every engineer started from scratch.” He was unceremoniously axed from DOGE on Day 55 after he discussedhis work there with a reporter from Fast Company. “I got the boot from DOGE,” he wrote. “Soon after publication, my access was revoked without warning.” In that FC interview, however, he also said working up close with the VA taught him that, while it was slow like a giant enterprise, it still “works.” “I would say the culture shock is mostly a lot of meetings, not a lot of decisions,” he says. “But honestly, it’s kind of fine — because the government works. It’s not as inefficient as I was expecting, to be honest. I was hoping for more easy wins.” His experience captures perfectly the dilemma of keeping enormous government agencies modern as they remain functional. While all taxpayers would like less waste, and the government can surely benefit from more programmers immersed in the latest tech, perhaps Silicon Valley volunteers swooping in like they are building a startup from scratch isn’t the answer. Lavingia did not immediately respond to our request for additional comment.

383,DeepSeek’s distilled new R1 AI model can run on a single GPU,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us DeepSeek’supdated R1 reasoning AI modelmight be getting the bulk of the AI community’s attention this week. But the Chinese AI lab also released a smaller, “distilled” version of its new R1, DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, that DeepSeek claims beats comparably sized models on certain benchmarks. The smaller updated R1, which was built using theQwen3-8B modelAlibaba launched in May as a foundation, performs better than Google’sGemini 2.5 Flashon AIME 2025, a collection of challenging math questions. DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B also nearly matches Microsoft’s recently releasedPhi 4 reasoning plusmodel on another math skills test, HMMT. So-called distilled models like DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B are generally less capable than their full-sized counterparts. On the plus side, they’re far less computationally demanding.Accordingto the cloud platform NodeShift, Qwen3-8B requires a GPU with 40GB-80GB of RAM to run (e.g., an Nvidia H100). The full-sized new R1 needsaround a dozen 80GB GPUs. DeepSeek trained DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B by taking text generated by the updated R1 and using it to fine-tune Qwen3-8B. In a dedicated web page for the model on the AI dev platform Hugging Face, DeepSeek describes DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B as “for both academic research on reasoning models and industrial development focused on small-scale models.” DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B is available under a permissive MIT license, meaning it can be used commercially without restriction.

384,Volteras wants to connect to more EVs than anyone else,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us For years, people have been worried — both rightly and otherwise — that electric vehicles could strain the grid to the breaking point. But as they spread, and as EV technology advances, some think theserolling battery packscould become a lifeline for the United States’ aging electrical system. “In the future, the electric vehicle will be the center of the entire energy grid,” Peter Wilson, co-founder and CEO ofVolteras, told TechCrunch. The potential is there: Last year, the U.S. installed37.1 gigawatt-hoursof grid-scale energy storage. The country could increase that amount by nearly 10 times if every EV on the road today was hooked up to a charger that can feed electricity back into the grid. There are a few hurdles, of course. Many new EVs today don’t support vehicle-to-grid connections, though that’s changing, and there’s a lack of affordable bidirectional chargers. ButVolterashas been making headway on the software side. Recently, the London-based startup closed an $11.1 million Series A led by Union Square Ventures, with participation from Edenred, Exor, Long Journey Ventures, and Wex, Volteras exclusively told TechCrunch. Volteras is building virtual connective tissue that will allow plugged-in EVs to offer their batteries to support the grid. When massed together, they can serve as virtual power plants, giving utilities quickly dispatchable power that’s distributed across the grid. Along with control over the car’s battery, Volteras also gets access to a host of other connected-car features, like remote unlocking and telematics. The company integrates with automakers’ own APIs and offers those functions to other companies interested in using them. In the case of a virtual power plant, a utility can pay EV owners to sell some of the car’s stored electricity back to the grid. Car rental services might subscribe, too, so they can remotely unlock vehicles for stranded motorists. Volteras charges those companies a monthly fee per connected car and passes on some of that revenue to automakers. Several companies are working on similar solutions to smooth the connection of EV batteries to the grid —Texture,EV.energy, andGreenely, to name a few — but Wilson argues that Volteras has a head start because his company is currently working with more than 30 automakers, which include Ford, BMW, Tesla, Stellantis, and Volvo. “We’re going to cover like 90% of the automotive market worldwide by the end of the year,” he said. Automakers have been salivating over the financial prospects of connected cars, though progress has been spotty. GM, for example, in 2021set a bold targetfor its subscription services: $25 billion in revenue by the end of the decade. But in itsmost recent annual report, the automaker didn’t offer an update. (Usually when things are going well, companies tell the world about it.) Wilson still sees potential in connected services, starting with the battery. In addition to virtual power plants, Volteras is courting fleet managers, EV routing apps, and insurers interested in offering usage-based plans. “This kind of hidden data layer that you don’t see — that’ll be the crux of how companies offer services to you, give you discounts, and make it more affordable to own an electric vehicle,” Wilson said.

385,Instagram Keeps Polishing Its Edits App to Woo Video Creators,"As I watchthrough my computer screen, Tom Bender, the product lead
forInstagram’s Edits, places a finger on his smartphone and the software traces
an outline around a chubby cat from some meme video. He then takes the furry
cutout and drops it over an existing video of himself within the Edits app,
adjusting the animal’s opacity to make the cat slightly see-through and ensuring
that his own visage in the background stays visible. This ability to fine-tune
overlay opacities was just one of many new and upcoming features he demonstrated
in a recent app walk-through for WIRED. While the Instagram platform wasfirst
known for photography, it’s now dominated by video. The new Edits app serves as
a companion to Instagram, but one that gives the next generation of video
creators all the tools they need tomake Reels. Edits launched last month
onAppleandAndroiddevices, after months of delays. Meta, which owns Instagram, is
putting Edits forward as a challenger to ByteDance’s CapCut app. That mobile
video editing tool, designed to supportTikTokcreators, was released
internationally in 2020 and has become the default choice for creating videos on
your phone. Although Edits initially squeaked past CapCut on Apple’s free
downloads chartsduring release week, the app now sits outside of the 100 most
downloaded apps on iOS. It sits far below its main competitor, which is
comfortably positioned in the top 10. (Meta declined to share current usage
numbers or other statistics for Edits.) Bender knows he needs to make the app
more attractive to creators. So, what’s his plan? Iteration, iteration,
iteration. “We launched a minimum viable product,” he says. “I think the most
important thing, from our perspective, is to listen to creators and just launch
great features every month or every week.” More video effects and filters are
rolling out now. Soon, you’ll be able to adjust the volume across all of the
clips in a project. In the next few weeks, an in-appteleprompter—so creators can
look right at the camera as they’re reading scripts—is set to drop. With Edits,
Instagram isn’t trying to usurp powerful desktop video editing tools like Adobe
Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro. Rather, the developers are targeting anyone
looking for better ways to craft social media videos on their smartphone. Bender
touts Edits’ preproduction tools, such as the existing Inspiration tab for
finding video ideas and saving trending Reels, as an example of Instagram
integrations designed with mobile video editors in mind. “Creators will have a
long Notes app file or DM threads where they send examples of videos,” he says.
“There's not a great way to keep track of all your ideas today.” After posting,
users can see insights into how the video performed on Instagram Reels inside of
the Edits app. Social mediavideo creators rarely post their work on just a
single platform; they’ll edit in one app (typically CapCut) and post to TikTok,
Instagram, X, and elsewhere. So why should they consider switching to Edits from
software they’re familiar with, beyond the Instagram integrations? “We
definitely hear that creators share to a lot of different platforms now,” says
Bender. One way to entice them to use Edits is to let all creators export their
video in high quality without adding a watermark. This gives it a leg up on
CapCut, which stamps an identifying watermark to the end of exported video
projects unless the user upgrades to a paid subscription. While Edits currently
has fewer features than CapCut, it’s completely free to use. Edits is receiving
several updates in the coming weeks, including the ability to adjust the volume
across all of the clips in a project. In addition to removing watermarks, paying
CapCut subscribers unlock more advanced and minute features, including a bevy
ofAI-focused tools: product photos, posters, models, and effects. Bender
believes AI tools that automate common tasks for mobile videos, like cutouts and
effects, are an area for growth in Edits. “There are ways we can keep human
creativity at the center, but just take out the tedium,” he says. His team is
also exploring how AI can be used to better analyze past videos from creators
that performed well on Instagram and suggest potential future topics tailored to
their niche audience. Users have been able to post videos on Instagram for over
a decade, and the algorithmic Reels feed first launched in 2020. Still, the
Edits app represents a new era for the social media platform. It’s a clear sign
the company currently prioritizes streamlined video creation of audience-
engaging posts. “That would be good for Instagram because creators will make
more videos,” says Bender. “The videos will be better, and then that makes
Instagram better for people watching videos.” It’s all part of Instagram’s plan
for more Reels, more viewers, and an overall more video-centric app. In your

opted to pair the action with more emotion than previous entries had seen.
Between that and an extended cast that includes Henry Cavill and Vanessa
Kirby—plus the return of Michelle Monaghan—it marks a different kind
ofMissionfor Hunt. WhileDisney+has been the go-to streamer for all things Star
Wars, Hulu decided to get in on the act as a special tribute for Star Wars Day.
On May the 4th, the iconic sci-fi franchise’s original trilogy arrived on the
streamer to be enjoyed for the umpteenth time by anyone over a certain age. Even
if you have little interest in the ever-expanding world based on the characters
that George Lucas created nearly half a century ago, the first three films are
different. They can easily be enjoyed as one-off features or simply as a
microcosm of the larger canon, as a lowly smuggler (Harrison Ford), a Jedi
knight (Mark Hamill), and a wisecracking princess (Carrie Fisher) join forces to
create what would unexpectedly become one of cinema’s greatest success stories.
We previously includedThe Orderin our list of “The 10 Best Movies You Missed in
2024,” and stand by that claim. Fortunately, the time has come for Hulu
subscribers to right that wrong. Justin Kurzel directs this gritty tale of
corruption and extremism from the Pacific Northwest to Middle America. Terry
Husk (Jude Law) is an FBI agent who believes that a series of daylight robberies
he’s investigating are linked to a local white supremacist group that is
attempting to fund a war on America. The investigation eventually leads him to
Bob Mathews (Nicholas Hoult), the unlikely leader of The Order, a neo-Nazi
group. That the film is based on a true story makes it all the more
heartbreaking. Eight months after winning the Best Actor Oscar forOppenheimer,
Cillian Murphy delivered just as powerful a performance in this adaptation of
Claire Keegan’s 2021 novella. It brings Murphy back to the kind of films he’s
best known for—quiet, character-driven indies about working class people. Here,
he plays Bill Furlong, a coal merchant, husband, and father of five daughters
who witnesses a disturbing scene with a young girl at the local convent and
school for girls. When he feels compelled to investigate further, and question
the young girl’s treatment, Bill puts a target on his own back—and that of his
family—when the convent’s Mother Superior (Emily Watson) believes Bill is asking
too many questions. Ultimately, despite veiled threats from the sister, his
compassion overwhelms his fear of retribution. Denis Villeneuvehas got a knack
for reinventing genres, as evidenced by the 2016 sci-fi filmArrival, which was
nominated for eight Oscars, including Best Picture. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is
a linguist who is still grieving the death of her young daughter when the Earth
is suddenly surrounded by several unidentified alien spacecraft. When Banks is
called upon to help decipher the alien language, her personal grief and
professional assignment find a way to collide, leading Banks to realize that
communicating with her fellow humans versus the extraterrestrial visitors might
be her bigger challenge. BetweenIt Follows,The Guest, andWatcher, Maika Monroe
has become this generation’s scream queen. She adds to that genre resume in this
offbeat thriller from Osgood Perkins (son ofPsychostar Anthony Perkins) playing
Lee Harker, an FBI agent who has a sixth sense when it comes to murder
investigations. But something feels eerily familiar when she’s asked to
investigate a string of murder-suicides that some of her colleagues believe is
the work of a possible serial killer. Monroe delivers yet another great
performance as Lee, but it's Nicolas Cage who delivers the most unhinged (to the
point of being unintentionally comical) performance here. Alien: Romulus—which
is set between the events ofAlien(1979) andAliens(1986)—is about a scenario
you’ve probably heard before: a group of people journeying around space find an
abandoned space station, which they decide to investigate. This, of course,
leads them right into the arms/faces of theAlienfranchise’s regular cast of
extraterrestrial baddies (see: facehuggers, chestbursters, and Xenomorphs).
Writer-director Fede Álvarez, who helmed the 2013Evil Deadreimagining, manages
to bring new life to a decades-old franchise with this sequel. Timothée Chalamet
shines in James Mangold’s Bob Dylan biopic, which earned eight Oscar
nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Chalamet.
The film follows Dylan’s early career, beginning in January 1961—when he
hitchhiked from Minnesota to New York City to meet and perform for his musical
idol, Woody Guthrie. That’s also where the then-19-year-old met folk musician
Pete Seeger (played by Edward Norton, who snagged a Best Supporting Actor nod),
who became one of Dylan’s earliest champions. Seeger was also instrumental in
Dylan’s game-changing performance at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, which is
where the movie culminates. Whether you know everything or nothing about Dylan,
it’s a fascinating story. If you missedAnorain theaters, you can now watch it on
Hulu—even if it did mess with your Oscar pool ballot. Anora, who prefers to be
called Ani (Best Actress winner Mikey Madison), is an exotic dancer whose
services are called upon when Vanya (Mark Eydelshteyn), the spoiled son of a
Russian oligarch, comes to the club where she works, asking for a dancer who
speaks Russian. Their VIP room evening turns into a (paid) sexual encounter
outside the club … then another, then another. During a spontaneous trip to Las
Vegas, the two get married, with Ani believing she has found her happily-ever-
after. Vanya’s parents are less optimistic and make it clear that Vanya has two
choices: his marriage or their money.Director Sean Baker, the critically
acclaimed filmmaker behindThe Florida Project(2017) andRed Rocket(2021), has yet
again made a powerful dramedy that highlights the plight of marginalized
characters. Gal Dove (Ray Winstone) is a former criminal who, after serving out
a prison sentence, has retired to Spain where he lives out his days lounging by
the pool and adored by a wife (Amanda Redman) he loves. But his bliss is
interrupted by the arrival of Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), a former associate and
Gal’s nemesis, who has been sent from London to recruit Gal for a complicated
heist. Despite Gal’s insistence that he’s retired, Don isn’t willing to take no
for an answer—which leads to a confrontation that could destroy the peaceful
existence Gal has created for himself. Winstone and Kingsley offer a masterclass
in acting as archenemies each doing their best to get what they want. Though
Kingsley earned an Oscar nomination for the role, the movie itself has been
largely—and unfortunately—forgotten. “If you’re Sly Stone, there’s no blueprint
for what comes next.” That’s the basic idea behindSly Lives!, Questlove’s
brilliant follow-up to the equally compellingSummer of Soul—the rockumentary
that won the Roots’ drummer an Academy Award in 2022. He could well be headed
for Oscar recognition once again with this deep dive into the rise and fall of
the groundbreaking band Sly & The Family Stone, and the higher standards to
which Black artists have traditionally been held. Questlove knows what he’s
talking about, and so he serves as a perfect guide into this side of the music
industry. Though it arrived in theaters in 1979,Alienhas lost none of its
potency in the intervening years—which isn’t something most fortysomethings can
say. By now you probably know the story by heart: The crew aboard the
spacecraftNostromo, including warrant officer Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver),
put a presumably slight pause on their trip back to Earth in order to respond to
a distress call from a nearby planetoid. But what they discover is a bizarre
alien life-form that seems to delight in knocking off crew members in new—and
frequently terrifying—ways. Can you say Facehugger? Or Chestburster?Alienis also
noteworthy for being the film that kicked off a bona fide, and legendary, sci-
fi/horror franchise—and introduced the world to Ridley Scott, who changed the
genre game yet again with his next feature,Blade Runner. Though the fifth film
in theAlienfranchise was met with mixed reviews upon its initial release in
2012, it’s one of those movies that has grown better with age and each
successive viewing. Ridley Scott directs a script cowritten by Jon Spaihts and
Damon Lindelof, which follows a team of scientists (led by Noomi Rapace and
Logan Marshall-Green) who are traveling the galaxy in the hopes of unlocking the
mysteries of how humankind came to be. But not every creature they encounter is
as interested in finding the answers to life’s big mysteries. The (kinda)
prequel marks Michael Fassbender’s first appearance in the franchise, playing a
jack-of-all-trades android (a role he reprised in 2017’sAlien: Covenant).
Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, Guy Pearce, and Ben Foster round out the stellar
cast. Kieran Culkin continues his run as Hollywood’s most lovable scene-stealer
in this buddy-ish road trip comedy written, directed, produced by, and
costarring Jesse Eisenberg (who earned an Oscar nod for the screenplay). David
(Eisenberg) and Benji (Culkin) travel to Poland in honor of their late
grandmother, a Holocaust survivor. Despite going down two very different paths
in life and their opposing personalities, the two find a way to reconnect and
prove that blood is thicker than water. Culkin just nabbed his first-ever Oscar
for the role, while Eisenberg wasgifted Polish citizenship. Nicolas Cage does
what Nicolas Cage does best (read: chew quite a bit of scenery) in this
postapocalyptic thriller in which a father, Paul (Cage), and his twin sons
Thomas (Jaeden Martell) and Joseph (Maxwell Jenkins) are three of the only
people remaining on earth. Making this scenario even more challenging is the
fact that they are terrorized at night by homicidal creatures dead-set on
ridding the planet of all humans. When Thomas goes missing, Paul must venture
out into the night to find him—an ill-advised adventure that ultimately leaves
Paul wounded, fighting for his life, and relying on his sons to keep them all
alive. Marielle Heller writes and directs this adaptation of Rachel Yoder’s 2018
novel—a bitingly dark horror-comedy about the challenges of motherhood. Amy
Adams reveals a ferocity rarely seen in the six-time Oscar nominee’s previous
performances. Here, she’s a stay-at-home mom simply known as Mother who begins
to resent her husband (Scoot McNairy) and even her young son for stripping her
of her previous identity as an artist. And at the same time, she begins to think
that maybe she’s turning into a dog. Which all makes a lot more sense in the
context of the movie. June Squibb is the action hero you didn’t know you needed.
In the decade since her Oscar-nominated turn in Alexander Payne’sNebraska, the
95-year-old actress has become one of Hollywood’s most in-demand actors. Here,
she plays the eponymous grandma who is swindled out of $10,000 by a phone
scammer targeting elderly citizens. When the authorities seem reluctant to take
any real action, Thelma grabs a gun and her motorized scooter and takes the law
into her own hands. Best of all? This vigilante comedy is based on writer-
director Josh Margolin’s own grandmother. At an unspecified date in the near
future, US Space Command Major Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) learns that mysterious
power surges originating from an old space station are posing a threat to Earth.
When he finds out that the activity can be traced back to the Lima Project—a
search for extraterrestrial life led by his father, H. Clifford McBride (Tommy
Lee Jones), who has been lost in space for 30 years—Roy journeys into the
unknown. When cowriter/director James Gray announced the project, he very boldly
stated that he was hoping to create “the most realistic depiction of space
travel that's been put in a movie.” Did he succeed? Watch and make your own
determination. In the 1970s, Jack Delroy (David Dastmalchian) is a late-night
talk show host who is constantly chasing Johnny Carson’s ratings but simply
cannot compete. He scores the highest ratings of his career when he sits down
for an interview with his beloved wife, Madeleine (Georgina Haig), who is dying
of cancer. When she passes away shortly afterward, Jack halts production on his
show entirely. When he’s eventually ready to come back to work he’s even more
determined to compete with Carson, so he decides to throw an occult-themed
Halloween show for the ages, complete with a psychic (Fayssal Bazzi), a
parapsychologist (Laura Gordon), and a possessed teen (Ingrid Torelli) who seems
to know more about Jack and Madeleine’s relationship than he bargained for. Many
critics have deemedLate Night With the Devilthebest horror movie of 2024—and
with good reason. Pamela Adlon’s directorial debut does for motherhood
whatBridesmaidsdid for marriage. New Yorkers Eden (Ilana Glazer) and Dawn
(Michelle Buteau) are lifelong best friends with decades of history and
traditions but now find themselves facing very different chapters in their
lives. Dawn, who is struggling with postpartum depression, is trying hard to
balance the demands of being a working mom and partner to her husband, while
Eden has never been burdened by such demands. But when she discovers she’s
pregnant after a one-night stand and determines that she is ready to be a single
mom, their friendship begins to fracture in ways they never would have imagined.
Glazer and Buteau’s chemistry as BFFs is undeniable in this brash comedy that
isn’t always pretty, in part because of its brutal honesty. True to its title,
the sixth film inThe Omenfranchise is a prequel to the 1976 horror classic that
birthed it. If you weren’t aware that there were half a dozen films in this
series, there’s a reason for that: Aside from the Richard Donner–directed
original, they’re just not very good. But nearly 50 years later,The First
Omenhas breathed new life into this seemingly tired premise. It’s 1971, and
Margaret (Nell Tiger Free), a young American novitiate, travels to Rome to work
at an orphanage. She quickly forms a bond with Carlita (Nicole Sorace), one of
the older wards, who is plagued by terrible visions. Despite warnings from the
head priest (Ralph Ineson) that “evil things” will happen if she engages with
Carlita, Margaret is convinced she can help the young girl. If you know anything
aboutThe Omenmovies, you probably know where this is headed: Satanic kids
bearing the mark of the devil (666) abound. Despite it being somewhat
predictable, the film is well acted and well made—and could very likely spawn
more entries. Just three months afterPoor Thingsscored four Oscar wins in 2024,
Yorgos Lanthimos got much of the gang back together—including Emma Stone, Willem
Dafoe, and Margaret Qualley—forKinds of Kindness, which debuted at Cannes.
Unlike his previous works, this one is an anthology film, or what came to be
marketed as a “triptych fable.” Just like the writer-director’s other movies, it
is born from a place of absurdist comedy and over-the-top performances from its
stars. Sex cults, reanimation, sandwiches, murder-happy bosses, and John
McEnroe’s smashed tennis racket all play a part in the wildly fun festivities.
Greta Gerwig is far (far) from the first writer-director to adapt Louisa May
Alcott’sLittle Womenfor the big screen. And she’s certainly not the first person
to do an admirable job of it. (Gillian Armstrong’s 1994 version starring Winona
Ryder and Christian Bale is still a much beloved interpretation.) Yet Gerwig
made the 19th century tale seem practically modern-day, and different from all
the rest, with seemingly small decisions like playing with the novel’s
timelines. It also doesn’t hurt that it just happens to star some of the most
impressive actors working today, including Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet,
Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, James Norton, Laura Dern, Chris
Cooper, Tracy Letts, Meryl Streep, and Bob Odenkirk. Sydney Sweeney produced
this religious horror flick and also stars as Cecilia, a young nun (yep, you
read that right) whose traumatic brush with death has convinced her that God
saved her for a higher purpose. When she is invited to join a convent in the
remote Italian countryside that assists older nuns at the end of their life, she
happily accepts—then quickly comes to realize that all may not be what it seems.
Enzo Ferrari (Adam Driver) is a man who should have it all: the one-time race
car driver and founder of the Ferrari car company oozes charm, wealth, and
excitement. But behind the scenes, the walls are closing in on him. Set during
the summer of 1957, Michael Mann’s biopic finds Ferrari (the man) on the verge
of bankruptcy, mourning the death of his son, and desperately trying to hide his
past indiscretions from his estranged wife—who helped build the car company and
who holds the key to his financial future. Though the film earned mixed reviews,
it does a solid job of telling the complex story of a complicated man. But its
biggest selling point is Penélope Cruz’s bravura performance. Nearly 60 years
into his career as a filmmaker, Wim Wenders managed to make one of his best
films yet withPerfect Days—which is saying a lot when you consider that this is
the same director who madeParis, Texas(1984) andWings of Desire(1987). Hirayama
(Kōji Yakusho) is a toilet cleaner in Tokyo who is blissfully content with the
simplicity of his life, as it allows him the time to indulge his more personal
passions: music (he’s an avid collector of cassette tapes and allows his
favorite music to set the soundtrack to his life), books, and nature. The movie
is not punctuated by any overly dramatic storylines; just the quiet interactions
that Hirayama has with those around him—family, coworkers, total strangers—and
the way those interludes impact him. It’s that poetic simplicity, and Yakusho’s
wonderful performance, that gives the film its heart. Writer-director Ava
DuVernay finds a way to yet again change the language of cinema with what is
both a biopic and a historical document. The movie is based on the life of
Isabel Wilkerson (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor), the first Black woman to win the
Pulitzer Prize in journalism for her work at The New York Times. It follows
Wilkerson’s journey to write her 2020 bookCaste: The Origins of Our
Discontents—a project that took her from the US to Germany to India to research
the troubling history of each country’s caste system and the parallels that
exist between them. On January 11, 1998, 22-year-old comedian Tomoaki Hamatsu
entered an apartment in Japan where he lived, nude and with no human contact,
for 15 months as part of an understandably controversial game show titledSusunu!
Denpa Shōnen. Hamatsu had no idea his life was being broadcast. This riveting
documentary delves into not just how anyone ever allowed this experiment to
happen, but the real-world effects—cultural, psychological, and beyond—it had on
both Hamatsu and the tens of millions of viewers who were somehow drawn into
witnessing his on-camera abuse. Between her starring roles inThe Zone of
InterestandAnatomy of a Fall,German actress Sandra Hüller made it clear that
when it comes to scripts, she knows how to pick ’em. In this compelling
courtroom drama, Hüller plays a successful writer turned murder suspect when her
husband (Samuel Theis) is found dead outside their home on a snowy day.
Ultimately, it might be her son (Milo Machado-Graner) and/or his guide dog
(Messi, the movie’srealstar) who ultimately seal Sandra’s fate. It’s a smart,
twisty, and well-acted mystery that will keep you guessing. It’s Always Sunny in
Philadelphia’s Glenn Howerton is practically unrecognizable in this immensely
entertaining recounting of the rise and fall of BlackBerry—the must-have cell
phone that had the world entranced before the iPhone came along. Howerton
costars as Jim Balsillie, the very real negotiator who, alongside Mike Lazaridis
(Jay Baruchel), gave the world its first smartphone. Which is a lot more
dramatic (and darkly humorous) than it sounds. Ozarkstar Julia Garner reunites
with director Kitty Green (The Assistant) for this taut psychological thriller
in which BFFs Hanna (Garner) and Liv (Jessica Henwick) decide to backpack their
way through the Australian outback. When they’re offered the chance to live and
work at a remote hotel in order to replenish their dwindling bank accounts, they
jump at the chance—despite Hanna feeling that something isn’t quite right with
their place of employment or its clientele. She’s on to something. Garner has
played one badass character after the next, andThe Royal Hotelis no exception.
New Girl’s Jake Johnson makes his feature directorial debut with this
wonderfully weird and occasionally dark meta comedy, which he also wrote and
stars in. Tommy Walcott (Johnson) is living a pretty ordinary existence until
he’s approached by Andy Samberg (as Andy Samberg), who offers him the chance of
a lifetime: the opportunity to win $1 million as part of a massive reality
competition. The only thing Tommy needs to do isnotget murdered for 30 days,
despite being hunted by dozens of contract killers whose job is to ensure that
no contestant walks away with the big prize. The catch? Contestants can only be
killed when they’re entirely alone. So Tommy takes it upon himself to partner up
with another contestant, which is where Maddy (Anna Kendrick) comes in. Since
they both have a cool mil to gain and a lot to lose (aka their lives) if they
don’t triumph, they make a pact to spend every waking moment of the next 30 days
together. Just when you think you know whereSelf Relianceis headed, it goes
ahead and surprises—and in the best ways possible. Home invasion thrillers are
never in short supply, but the really effective ones are hard to come by.
Kaitlyn Dever shines—and proves yet again that she can shoulder the weight of an
entire film—as Brynn Adams, a seamstress living a solitary existence in her
childhood home and mourning the loss of her mother and closest friend. When she
wakes up one night to discover that someone is in her house, that someone turns
out to besomething. A home invasion thriller with extraterrestrials might not
have been on your must-watch Bingo card, butNo One Will Save Youis 93 minutes
well spent. Miguel (Tyler Dean Flores) is 17 years old and has never been in a
fight. So when he learns that he’ll be moving away from the place and people he
has known all his life, he enlists his pals to help him get into his first
fistfight. It’s probably not the first coming-of-age ritual to spring to mind,
but it’s certainly among them. A talented cast of young actors make this
comedy—cowritten by Shea Serrano and Jason Concepcion—immensely watchable. Hal
Porterfield (Christopher Abbott) has just been handed the keys to the castle
following the death of his hotel magnate father. Rebecca Marin (Margaret
Qualley) is a dominatrix who believes she deserves some of the credit—and half
the cash—that comes with Hal’s new CEO position. Sexual politics have rarely
played out as twisted, or darkly funny, as they do in this mesmerizing, and
often claustrophobic, thriller from Zachary Wigon. Vicky Krieps delivers yet
another top-notch performance as Empress Elisabeth of Austria, who—following her
40th birthday—longs to recapture the freedom of her youth. Marie Kreutzer writes
and directs this fictional biopic (Empress Elisabeth is real, though the story
told within takes plenty of creative liberties), which sees the royal rebelling
against her lack of power to affect any real change, despite her title. Even
more so, it’s about a woman who is desperate to hold on to the power that youth
and beauty entitle her to—regardless of the consequences. Environmentalism meets
heist movie in director Daniel Goldhaber's thriller about a group of young
people who try to—as the title implies—expose the fragility of the oil industry.
It's not often that a movie examining the fight against the climate crisis is
also an edge-of-your-seat adventure, but here those elements come together
beautifully. (You can give cinematographer Tehillah de Castro a bit of credit
for that.) Smart, prescient, and nearly unprecedented,How to Blow Up a
Pipelineis more than worth the stream. Raine Allen-Miller's directorial debut
offers a playful twist on the typical rom-com. Yas (Vivian Oparah) and Dom
(David Jonsson) are both twentysomethings reeling from recent break-ups. After a
chance—and rather awkward—first meeting, the pair spend a day wandering around
South London, bonding over their shared experience, finding cheeky ways to get
over the mourning of their previous relationships, and maybe discovering that
romance is not dead after all. Think of it likeGilligan’s Island, but with more
class commentary and vomit. When a bunch of rich people head out to sea on a
luxury yacht, their plans are thwarted when a terrible storm leaves many of them
stranded on a beach where none of their money or power can help them survive.
That already gives away too much, but suffice to say, if you likeThe Menu-esque
critiques of the excesses of wealth with just as many dark-comedy twists, this
Oscar-nominated film is right for you. OK, so this might be the movie that
turned the idea of “lesbian period drama” into a trope, but it’s also one of the
best modern queer romance films around, alongsideMoonlightandCarol. Set on an
isolated French coast in the late-1700s, writer-director Céline Sciamma’s film
centers on a young aristocrat woman, Héloïse (Adèle Haenel), who is betrothed to
a wealthy Milanese man. When Héloïse’s mother hires Marianne (Noémie Merlant) to
paint a portrait of her daughter, the two women fall in love and have the kind
of heartbreaking affair that made lesbian period dramas so undeniable in the
first place. You’ll be transfixed. Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is a single woman who
is on the lookout for a partner but tired of the online dating scene. When she
meets Steve (Sebastian Stan), a quirky, handsome stranger, she decides to give
him her number. The two hit it off on the first date and eventually find
themselves making plans to spend a weekend away—which is when Noa realizes that
Steve has been hiding a few disturbing details about himself.
Ultimately,Freshstands as a lesson in the horrors of dating in the digital age
(both real and imagined). Given the existence of Harold Ramis’ near-
perfectGroundhog Day, it takes a whole lot of chutzpah for a filmmaker to add
another picture to the infinite-time-loop rom-com canon. But writer-director Max
Barbakow did it anyway withPalm Springs, and audiences are thankful he did.
Building upon the rules originally established inGroundhog Day,Palm
Springsoffers its own unique twist on the story. Instead of showing one person
(Bill Murray’s Phil Conners) slowly being pushed to the brink of insanity
because he’s the only one who seems to be experiencing the phenomenon,Palm
Springshas three wedding guests—Nyles (Andy Samberg), Sarah (Cristin Milioti),
and Roy (J. K. Simmons)—living the same day again and again and working together
to find a way out of it. In your inbox:Upgrade your life withWIRED-tested gear

387,Another Top Musk Lieutenant Appears to Be Leaving DOGE,"One of ElonMusk’stop allies at the General Services Administration(GSA), Nicole
Hollander, appears to be scaling back her work for the agency, according to
sources and documents obtained by WIRED. Since January, Hollander, who is
affiliated with Musk’s so-calledDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE), has
been working on real estate projects related to federal leases and office
buildings for GSA. The move is part of apurported wind-downforMuskand his
leadership team at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. On
Wednesday,Musk posted on Xthat his “scheduled time as a Special Government
Employee” was coming to an end and thanked President Trump for “the opportunity
to reduce wasteful spending.” The post echoed remarks Musk made last month in
aQ1 earnings call with Tesla shareholders, where he said he’d be spending just
“a day or two a week on government matters.” It’s not yet clear whether those
remarks were made to appease Tesla shareholders or truly reflect a decision to
scale back Musk’s government involvement. Steve Davis, a longtime Musk
lieutenant, is also reportedly leaving DOGE, according to theThe Wall Street
Journal. Davis has played a key role in Musk’s government operations, including
overseeingbudget cutsand hiring practices. He’s also Hollander’s partner. Both
Davis and Hollander played an instrumental role in Musk’sTwitter takeover in
2022. During that transition, they moved into the Twitter office building in San
Francisco with their newborn baby. Hollander oversaw real estate projects for
Twitter (now X), while Davis managed a brutal cost-cutting program known as
zero-based budgeting. When they were done, the company was almost
unrecognizable, with a real estate footprint and employee base a fraction of its
former size. Their time in government has also seen a radical shrinking of the
federal workforce, with tens of thousands of employeeslosing their jobs. Since
February, the GSA has been carrying out plans to prepare to sell hundreds
offederal office buildings. With Davis and Hollander apparently out, their cost-
cutting work seems to be continuing: On May 29, GSA sent out amemosaying it was
speeding up the sale or transfer of the Captain John F. Williams Coast Guard
building, which is the United States Coast Guard’s New England headquarters. GSA
employees say no official announcement has been made regarding Davis and
Hollander—and noted they’ve seen multiple members of the DOGE team in the office
in recent weeks. Edward Coristine—the young engineer known online as“Big
Balls”—appears, for example, to be continuing his government work, scheduling
meetings with agencies including the Treasury and the Federal Emergency
Management Agency as recently as May 29. The White House did not immediately
respond to a request for comment by WIRED. The GSA also did not respond to a
request for comment by WIRED. Hollander, reached via a direct message on X, also
did not respond prior to publication. In your inbox:Upgrade your life withWIRED-

388,The US Is Storing Migrant Children’s DNA in a Criminal Database,"The United Statesgovernment has collectedDNAsamples from upwards of 133,000
migrant children and teenagers—including at least one 4-year-old—and uploaded
their genetic data into a national criminal database used by local, state, and
federal law enforcement, according to documents reviewed by WIRED. The records,
quietly released by the US Customs and Border Protection earlier this year,
offer the most detailed look to date at the scale of CBP’s controversial DNA
collection program. They reveal for the first time just how deeply the
government’s biometric surveillance reaches into the lives of migrant children,
some of whom may still be learning to read or tie their shoes—yet whose DNA is
now stored in a system originally built for convicted sex offenders and violent
criminals. WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is based
on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests or public government
documents.Please consider subscribing to support our journalism. The Department
of Justice has argued that extensive DNA collection activity at the border
provides “an assessment of the danger” a migrant potentially “poses to the
public” and will essentially help solve crimes that may be committed in the
future. Experts say that the children’s raw genetic material will be stored
indefinitely and worry that, without proper guardrails, the DNA dragnet could
eventually be used for more extensive profiling. Spanning from October 2020
through the end of 2024, the records show that CBP swabbed the cheeks of between
829,000 and 2.8 million people, with experts estimating that the true figure,
excluding duplicates, is likely well over 1.5 million. That number includes as
many as 133,539 children and teenagers. These figures mark a sweeping expansion
of biometric surveillance—one that explicitly targets migrant populations,
including children. The DNA samples are registered in the Combined DNA Index
System, or CODIS, a database administered by the FBI, which processes the DNA
and stores the resulting genetic profiles. A network of criminal forensic
databases, CODIS is used by local, state, and federal enforcement agencies to
match DNA collected from crime scenes or convictions to identify suspects. On
May 10, 2024, for instance, records say that CBP agents from the El Paso, Texas,
field office collected a DNA sample from the mouth of an individual in its
custody whom CBP identified as Cuban and who was detained for allegedly being an
“immigrant w/o docs.” Swabbing the individuals’ cheek, the agents obtained a DNA
sample containing the individual's entire genetic code and then sent the sample
to the FBI for processing. According to CBP records, the individual was just 4
years old. Of the tens of thousands of minors whose DNA was collected by Customs
and Border Protection over the past four years, as many as 227 were 13 or
younger, including the 4-year-old. Department of Homeland Security policy states
that individuals under 14 are generally exempt from DNA collection, but field
officers have the discretion to collect DNA in some circumstances. The data
shows additional entries for kids aged 10, 11, 12, and 13. The numbers spike
beginning at age 14; more than 30,000 entries were logged for each age group
from 14 to 17. “In order to secure our borders, CBP is devoting every resource
available to identify who is entering our country. We are not letting human
smugglers, child sex traffickers, and other criminals enter American
communities,” Hilton Beckham, assistant commissioner of public affairs at CBP,
tells WIRED in a statement. “Toward this end, CBP collects DNA samples for
submission to the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) from persons in CBP
custody who are arrested on federal criminal charges, and from aliens detained
under CBP’s authority who are subject to fingerprinting and not otherwise exempt
from the collection requirement.” Under current rules, DNA is generally
collected from anyone who is also fingerprinted. According to DHS policy, 14 is
the minimum age at which fingerprinting becomes routine. As many as 122 minors
were categorized as American citizens, 53 of whom were not detained for any
criminal arrest, CBP records say. (People asking to enter the United States to
apply for asylum are put in civil rather than criminal custody.) Multiple legal,
privacy, and immigration experts described the findings as deeply troubling.
“It’s horribly dystopian,” says Vera Eidelman, a senior staff attorney with the
American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “It’s
impossible for me to think of a reason to collect a 4-year-old’s DNA and upload
it to a database that’s explicitly supposed to be about criminal activity.” As
one of the world’s largest law enforcement agencies, CBP is responsible for
intercepting and processing individuals who cross the US border without
authorization. While Immigration and Customs Enforcement handles long-term
detention and deportation, CBP controls the earliest, most vulnerable hours of a
migrant’s legal journey in the US, often when they are first taken into custody,
questioned, and in many cases fingerprinted and swabbed for DNA. Both CBP and
ICE operate under the Department of Homeland Security and, under current policy,
are authorized to collect fingerprints and DNA from anyone in their custody as
young as 14 years old. Exceptions for younger children can be made in certain
cases involving “potentially criminal situations”; however, the CBP data
analyzed by WIRED indicates this was the case in as few as 2.2 percent of the
hundreds of kids subjected to DNA swabs. Of the 227 people listed in the data as
children under 14 and having their DNA submitted to the FBI, most of them are
simply labeled “detainee.” Only five were listed as arrestees or linked to
criminal charges. CBP’s participation in the CODIS program isn’t new, though it
expanded significantly after a2020 Department of Justice ruleamending a previous
exemption that effectively allowed DHS to avoid collecting DNA from civil
immigration detainees. Sara Huston, an expert in genomics policy and the
principal investigator at the Genetics and Justice Laboratory and a research
assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School
of Medicine, tells WIRED that CODIS is a powerful tool for law enforcement when
solving violent crimes, sexual assaults, and missing persons cases. Huston
explains that typically when DNA is collected from a crime scene—such as in a
sexual assault case—it’s processed and uploaded to CODIS and compared with DNA
from anyone in the database, which includes people who have been previously
arrested for certain crimes or convicted. A match can help investigators connect
unsolved cases, identify suspects, and share critical leads across
jurisdictions. But the inclusion of migrants, the vast majority of whom were not
listed in CBP data as having been accused of any felonies, raises deeper
questions about what kind of data belongs in a criminal database. CODIS was
designed to track criminal offenders, not to permanently catalog the genetic
information of undocumented children passing through immigration custody. “It’s
not that we can’t solve crimes by collecting these samples—that’s why CODIS
exists, and it’s a wonderful tool,” Huston says. “But it’s not a fair system to
keep DNA of people who have not committed crimes on the assumption that they
likely will.” Apprehensions of migrants who crossed the border unlawfully
between ports of entry have since fallen to historic lows during the current
Trump administration; it's unclear whether the pace of DNA collection has also
slowed, as the most recent data ends on December 31, 2024. The data, which CBP
published to its website in February, shows that DNA collection accelerated
under the Biden administration, with daily submissions to CODIS increasing
sharply in 2024 alongside areported rise in border apprehensions. On a single
day in January 2024, for example, the Laredo, Texas, field office submitted as
many as 3,930 DNA samples to the FBI—252 were listed as 17 or younger, CBP
records show. The DOJ has defended the mass collection of DNA at the border as
necessary for solving crimes. In its official rationale, the agency argues that
this sweeping effort is “essential” not only for identifying migrants who may
have committed crimes in the past but also for potentially solving crimes they
might commit in the future. For Stevie Glaberson, the director of research and
advocacy at the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown Law, the
implication is clear: The US government is treating every person who crosses the
border, regardless of age, legal status, or whether they’re accused of any
wrongdoing, as a possible suspect in crimes yet to occur. If the government’s
goal is to determine whether a detainee is connected to past crimes, Glaberson
tells WIRED, there would be no need to add that person’s DNA to CODIS—they could
simply check for a match against existing profiles. “It’s hard to imagine a
situation where a 4-year-old was involved in criminal activity,” Glaberson says.
“Taking DNA from a 4-year old and adding it into CODIS flies in the face of any
immigration purpose,” she says, adding, “That’s not immigration enforcement.
That’s genetic surveillance.” Multiplestudiesshowno linkbetween immigration
andincreased crime. In 2024, Glaberson coauthored a report called “Raiding the
Genome” that was the first to try to quantify DHS’s 2020 expansion of DNA
collection. It found that if DHS continues to collect DNA at the rate the agency
itself projects, one-third of the DNA profiles in CODIS by 2034 will have been
taken by DHS, and seemingly without any real due process—the protections that
are supposed to be in place before law enforcement compels a person to hand over
their most sensitive information. CBP collects DNA using buccal swab kits—long
cotton-tipped sticks used to scrape the inside of a detainee’s cheek. While the
DNA sample itself contains a person’s entire genetic code, Huston says that
what’s uploaded to CODIS is better understood as a lower-resolution snapshot—a
DNA profile made up of select genetic markers used solely to identify
individuals—and is not intended to reveal traits, health conditions, or genetic
predispositions. However, both she and Glaberson note that the raw DNA sample
itself could be stored indefinitely. The DOJ did not respond to multiple
requests for comment, nor did it answer questions about how long raw DNA samples
are stored. However, a current DOJ official, speaking to WIRED on the condition
of anonymity due to fear of retribution, defended the collection and retention
of migrant DNA. Storing raw samples, they say, is necessary for due process—to
confirm that a match in CODIS can be traced back to the original raw material.
“If you aren’t committing a crime, being in this database isn’t going to affect
you,” they say, arguing that a larger pool of DNA increases the chances of
finding a match. Under federal law, CODIS data and the raw genetic samples can
only be used for identification in criminal cases.DHS policystates that DNA
samples may not be used to discriminate “in the provision of health benefits or
other services” and that DNA samples are not used by the FBI to “reveal any
physical traits, race, ethnicity, disease susceptibility, or other sensitive
information about an individual.” But privacy advocates worry that those rules
aren’t enough, since policies can change and new uses can emerge alongside new
technology. For instance, privacy and civil liberties experts have warned that
the government could one day use DNA to link immigrants to family members, who
could also be targeted by law enforcement. Another concern is that genetic data
might be reanalyzed to predict health-relatedmarkers or inherited
conditions—potentially influencing decisions about admissibility or whether
someone is likely to require government support. As Glaberson warns, “The
warehousing of genetic samples containing the entirety of people's genetic code
presents a risk in the future.” Updated at 5:19 pm ET, May 29, 2025: Added

389,Trump’s Crackdown on Foreign Student Visas Could Derail Critical AI Research,"Secretary of StateMarco Rubiosaid Wednesday that the US plans to “aggressively
revoke” the visas of Chinese students, including those working in critical
fields or with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Experts warn the move—along
with the Trump administration’s broader crackdown on international
students—could drain American scientific labs of top STEM talent and upend
cutting-edge research in areas likeartificial intelligence. “If you were aiming
to help China beat the US at AI, the first thing you would do is disrupt the
flow of top talent from all around the world into the US,” says Helen Toner,
director of strategy and foundational research grants at Georgetown University’s
Center for Security and Emerging Technology. While it has a population only
about a quarter the size of China,  “the US has had a huge asymmetric advantage
in attracting the cream of the global crop,” she adds. Several close Trump
allies, including Elon Musk, have argued that attracting the best engineers from
around the world is essential for the US to maintain its technological
dominance. But more populist figures in the White House, like top policy chief
Stephen Miller, have long advocated for reducing immigration levels—seemingly at
any cost. “It is almost funny, because the White House has said that artificial
intelligence is one of the top priorities for this country, but now they are
trying to send the people who are doing this kind of research home,” says Zilin
Ma, a PhD student from China studying AI computer interfaces at Harvard
University, which has been at the center of the Trump administration’s crusade
against US colleges. Rubio’s announcement came the day after the State
Department sent a cable to US embassies ordering them to temporarily suspend
scheduling interviews for all prospective international students, regardless of
their country of origin. The cable,which was leaked to Politico, said the pause
would allow the Trump administration time to consider potentially expanding
social media screening procedures for visa applicants. The State Department
declined to answer questions from WIRED about changes to its student visa
policies. In an unsigned email, the department’s press office said it doesn’t
comment on internal communications and noted that the US government has required
visa applicants to share information about their social media accounts since
2019. Vincent Conitzer, a computer scientist specializing in AI at Carnegie
Mellon University, says America’s ability to attract top talent has been an
important and long-standing asset for its domestic tech industry, which is
already facing growing international competition. “The rest of the world has for
a long time envied the US for being able to attract the world's best students,”
Conitzer says. “That's not to say that we shouldn't screen students who want to
come into this country, but they need to understand that they'll be treated
fairly, or none of them are going to come in the first place, and that will hit
the US hard—the economy, the technology base, and more.” More than880,000
international students, mostly from India and China, were enrolled at US
colleges and universities in the 2023-2024 academic year. Foreigners make up
particularly large shares of STEM graduate programs: Over 36 percent of STEM
master’s degrees and 46 percent of STEM PhDs in the US were awarded to
international students in the 2021-2022 academic year,according to datafrom the
National Center for Education Statistics. At some US colleges, international
students make up the majority of doctoral students in departments like computer
science. At the University of Chicago, for example, foreign nationals accounted
for57 percentof newly enrolled computer science PhD students last year,
according to data published by the school. Since international students often
pay full tuition, they provide funding that schools can then use to expand their
programs. As a result, foreign-born students are generally not taking education
opportunities from Americans, but rather creating more slots overall, according
to areportreleased earlier this month from the National Foundation for American
Policy. Researchers from the nonpartisan think tank estimated that each
additional PhD awarded to an international student in a STEM field is
“associated with an additional PhD awarded to a domestic student.” Restricting
student visas and reducing the number of foreign nationals studying computer
science “will profoundly impact the field in the United States,” says Rebecca
Willett, a professor at the University of Chicago whose work focuses on the
mathematical and statistical foundations of machine learning. Willett adds that
the move “risks depleting a vital pipeline of skilled professionals, weakening
the US workforce, and jeopardizing the nation's position as a global leader in
computing technology.” Mehran Sahami, the chair of Stanford University’s
computer science department, describes the student visa policy changes as
“counterproductive.” He declined to share how many foreign students are enrolled
in Stanford’s computer science program, which includes both graduate and
undergraduate students, but he acknowledges that it’s “a lot.” “They add a lot
to it, and they have for decades. It’s a way to bring the best and brightest
minds to the US to study, and they end up contributing to the economy
afterwards,” Sahami says. But now he worries that talent will “end up going to
other countries.” Thevast majorityof PhD students from China and India say they
intend to stay in the United States after they graduate, while the majority from
some other countries, such as Switzerland and Canada, report planning to leave.
Foreign-born STEM graduates who remain in the US frequently go on to work at
American universities, private tech firms, or become startup founders in Silicon
Valley. Immigrants founded or cofoundednearly two-thirdsof the top AI companies
in the United States, according to a 2023 analysis by the National Foundation
for American Policy. William Lazonick, an economist who has extensively studied
innovation and global competition, says that the US experienced an influx of
foreign students studying STEM disciplines beginning in the 1980s as fields like
microelectronics and biopharmaceuticals were undergoing a technological
revolution. During the same period, Lazonick says, he observed many American
students choosing to enter careers in finance instead of the hard sciences. “It
is my sense, from being a faculty member at both public and private universities
in the United States, that foreign students pursuing STEM careers have been
critical to the very existence of graduate programs in the relevant science and
engineering disciplines,” Lazonick tells WIRED. As the Trump administration
works to restrict the flow of international students and slash federal research
funding, governments and universities around the world have launchedelaborate
campaignsto courtinternational studentsand US scientists, eager to take
advantage of a rare opportunity to snap up American talent. “Hong Kong is trying
to attract Harvard students. The UK is setting up scholarships for students,”
says Shaun Carver, executive director of International House, a student
residential center at UC Berkeley. “They see this as brain gain. And for us,
it’s a brain drain.” In your inbox:Upgrade your life withWIRED-tested gear “Wi-

390,Meta’s ‘Free Expression’ Push Results in Far Fewer Content Takedowns,"Meta announced inJanuary itwould endsome content moderation efforts, loosen its
rules, and put more emphasis on supporting “free expression.” The shifts
resulted in fewer posts being removed from Facebook and Instagram, the
companydisclosedThursday in its quarterly Community Standards Enforcement
Report. Meta said thatits new policieshad helped reduce erroneous content
removals in the US by half without broadly exposing users to more offensive
content than before the changes. The newreport, which was referenced in an
update to a January blog post by Meta global affairs chief Joel Kaplan, shows
that Meta removed nearly one-third less content on Facebook and Instagram
globally for violating its rules from January to March of this year than it did
in the previous quarter, or about 1.6 billion items compared to just under 2.4
billion, according to an analysis by WIRED. In the past several quarters, the
tech giant’s total quarterly removals had previously risen or stayed flat.
Across Instagram and Facebook, Meta reported removing about 50 percent fewer
posts for violating its spam rules, nearly 36 percent less for child
endangerment, and almost 29 percent less for hateful conduct. Removals increased
in only one major rules category—suicide and self-harm content—out of the 11
that Meta lists. The amount of content Meta removes fluctuates regularly from
quarter to quarter, and a number of factors could have contributed to the dip in
takedowns. But the company itself acknowledged that “changes made to reduce
enforcement mistakes” was one reason for the large drop. “Across a range of
policy areas we saw a decrease in the amount of content actioned and a decrease
in the percent of content we took action on before a user reported it,” the
company wrote. “This was in part because of the changes we made to ensure we are
making fewer mistakes. We also saw a corresponding decrease in the amount of
content appealed and eventually restored.” Meta relaxed some of its content
rules at the start of the year that CEO Mark Zuckerberg described as “just out
of touch with mainstream discourse.” The changes allowed Instagram and Facebook
users toemploy some languagethat human rights activists view as hateful toward
immigrants or individuals that identify as transgender. For example, Meta now
permits “allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or
sexual orientation.” As part of the sweeping changes, which were announced just
as Donald Trump was set to begin his second term as US president, Meta also
stopped relying as much on automated tools to identify and remove posts
suspected of less severe violations of its rules because it said they had high
error rates, prompting frustration from users. During the first quarter of this
year, Meta’s automated systems accounted for 97.4 percent of content removed
from Instagram under the company’s hate speech policies, down by just 1
percentage point from the end of last year. (User reports to Meta triggered the
remaining percentage.) But automated removals for bullying and harassment on
Facebook dropped nearly 12 percentage points. In some categories, such as
nudity, Meta’s systems were slightly more proactive compared to the previous
quarter. Users can appeal content takedowns, and Meta sometimes restores posts
that it determines have been wrongfully removed. In the update to Kaplan’s blog
post, Meta highlighted the large decrease in erroneous takedowns. “This
improvement follows the commitment we made in January to change our focus to
proactively enforcing high-severity violations and enhancing our accuracy
through system audits and additional signals,” the company wrote. Some Meta
employees told WIRED in Januarythat they were concernedthe policy changes could
lead to a dangerous free-for-all on Facebook and Instagram, turning the
platforms into increasingly inhospitable places for users to converse and spend
time. But according to its own sampling, Meta estimates that users were exposed
to about one to two pieces of hateful content on average for every 10,000 posts
viewed in the first quarter, down from about two to three at the end of last
year. And Meta’s platforms have continued growing—about 3.43 billion people in
March used at least one of its apps, which include WhatsApp and Messenger, up
from 3.35 billion in December. In your inbox:Upgrade your life withWIRED-tested

391,Starship’s Latest Test Reveals New Problems for SpaceX to Solve,"SpaceX made someprogress on another test flight of the world’s most powerful
rocket Tuesday, finally overcoming technical problems that plagued the program’s
two previous launches. But minutes into the mission,SpaceX’sStarship lost
control as it cruised through space, then tumbled back into the atmosphere
somewhere over the Indian Ocean nearly an hour after taking off from Starbase,
Texas, the company’s privately owned spaceport near the US-Mexico border.
SpaceX’s next-generation rocket is designed to eventually ferry cargo and
private and government crews between the Earth, themoon, andMars. The rocket is
complex and gargantuan, wider and longer than aBoeing747 jumbo jet, and after
nearly two years of steady progress since its first test flight in 2023, this
has been a year of setbacks for Starship. During the rocket’s two previous test
flights—each using an upgraded “Block 2” Starship design—problems in the ship’s
propulsion system led to leaks during launch, eventually triggering an early
shutdown of the rocket’s main engines. On both flights, the vehicle spun out of
control and broke apart, spreading debris over an area near the Bahamas and the
Turks and Caicos Islands. The good news is that that didn’t happen Tuesday. The
ship’s main engines fired for their full duration, putting the vehicle on its
expected trajectory toward a splashdown in the Indian Ocean. For a short time,
it appeared the ship was on track for a successful flight. “Starship made it to
the scheduled ship engine cutoff, so big improvement over last flight! Also, no
significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent,”wrote Elon Musk, SpaceX’s
founder and CEO, on X. The bad news is that Tuesday’s test flight revealed more
problems, preventing SpaceX from achieving the most important goals Musk
outlined going into the launch. “Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during
the coast and reentry phase,” Musk posted on X. “Lot of good data to review.”
With the loss of tank pressure, the rocket started slowly spinning as it coasted
through the blackness of space more than 100 miles above the Earth. This loss of
control spelled another premature end to a Starship test flight. Most notable
among the flight’s unmet objectives was SpaceX’s desire to study the performance
of the ship’s heat shield, which includes improved heat-absorbing tiles to
better withstand the scorching temperatures of reentry back into the atmosphere.
“The most important thing is data on how to improve the tile design, so it’s
basically data during the high heating, reentry phase in order to improve the
tiles for the next iteration,” Musktold Ars Technicabefore Tuesday’s flight. “So
we’ve got like a dozen or more tile experiments. We’re trying different coatings
on tiles. We’re trying different fabrication techniques, different attachment
techniques. We’re varying the gap filler for the tiles.” Engineers are hungry
for data on the changes to the heat shield, which can’t be fully tested on the
ground. SpaceX officials hope the new tiles will be more robust than the ones
flown on the first-generation, or Block 1, version of Starship, allowing future
ships to land and quickly launch again, without the need for time-consuming
inspections, refurbishment, and in some cases, tile replacements. This is a core
tenet of SpaceX’s plans for Starship, which include delivering astronauts to the
surface of the moon, proliferating low Earth orbit with refueling tankers, and
eventually helping establish a settlement on Mars, all of which are predicated
on rapid reusability of Starship and its Super Heavy booster. Last year, SpaceX
successfully landed three Starships in the Indian Ocean after they survived
hellish reentries, but they came down with damaged heat shields. After an early
end to Tuesday’s test flight, SpaceX’s heat shield engineers will have to wait a
while longer to satiate their appetites. And the longer they have to wait, the
longer the wait for other important Starship developmental tests, such as a full
orbital flight, in-space refueling, and recovery and reuse of the ship itself,
replicating what SpaceX has now accomplished with the Super Heavy booster. The
ninth flight of Starship began with a booming departure from SpaceX’s Starbase
launch site at 6:35 pm CDT (7:35 pm EDT; 23:35 UTC) Tuesday. After a brief hold
to resolve last-minute technical glitches, SpaceX resumed the countdown clock to
tick away the final seconds before liftoff. A gush of water poured over the deck
of the launch pad just before 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines ignited on the
rocket’s massive Super Heavy first stage booster. Once all 33 engines lit, the
enormous stainless steel rocket—towering more than 400 feet (123 meters)—began
to climb away from Starbase. An onboard camera shows the six Raptor engines on
SpaceX’s Starship upper stage, roughly three minutes after launching from South
Texas on Tuesday. Heading east, the Super Heavy booster produced more than twice
the power of NASA’s Saturn V rocket, an icon of the Apollo moon program, as it
soared over the Gulf of Mexico. After two and a half minutes, the Raptor engines
switched off and the Super Heavy booster separated from Starship’s upper stage.
Six Raptor engines fired on the ship to continue pushing it into space. As the
booster started maneuvering for an attempt to target an intact splashdown in the
sea, the ship burned its engines more than six minutes, reaching a top speed of
16,462 mph (26,493 kilometers per hour), right in line with preflight
predictions. A member of SpaceX’s launch team declared “nominal orbit insertion”
a little more than nine minutes into the flight, indicating the rocket reached
its planned trajectory, just shy of the velocity required to enter a stable
orbit around the Earth. The flight profile was supposed to take Starship halfway
around the world, with the mission culminating in a controlled splashdown in the
Indian Ocean northwest of Australia. But a few minutes after engine shutdown,
the ship started to diverge from SpaceX’s flight plan. First, SpaceX aborted an
attempt to release eight simulated Starlink Internet satellites in the first
test of the Starship's payload deployer. The cargo bay door would not fully
open, and engineers called off the demonstration, according to Dan Huot, a
member of SpaceX’s communications team who hosted the company’s live launch
broadcast Tuesday. That, alone, would not have been a big deal. However, a few
minutes later, Huot made a more troubling announcement. “We are in a little bit
of a spin,” he said. “We did spring a leak in some of the fuel tank systems
inside of Starship, which a lot of those are used for attitude control. So, at
this point, we’ve essentially lost our attitude control with Starship.” This
eliminated any chance for a controlled reentry and an opportunity to thoroughly
scrutinize the performance of Starship’s heat shield. The spin also prevented a
brief restart of one of the ship’s Raptor engines in space. “Not looking great
for a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,” Huot said. SpaceX continued
streaming live video from Starship as it soared over the Atlantic Ocean and
Africa. Then, a blanket of super-heated plasma enveloped the vehicle as it
plunged into the atmosphere. Still in a slow tumble, the ship started shedding
scorched chunks of its skin before the screen went black. SpaceX lost contact
with the vehicle around 46 minutes into the flight. The ship likely broke apart
over the Indian Ocean, dropping debris into a remote swath of sea within its
expected flight corridor. Although the flight did not end as well as SpaceX
officials hoped, the company made some tangible progress Tuesday. Most
importantly, it broke the streak of back-to-back launch failures on Starship’s
two most recent test flights in January and March. SpaceX’s investigation
earlier this year into a January 16 launch failure concluded that vibrations
likely triggered fuel leaks and fires in the ship’s engine compartment, causing
an early shutdown of the rocket’s engines. Engineers said the vibrations were
likely in resonance with the vehicle’s natural frequency, intensifying the
shaking beyond the levels SpaceX predicted. Engineers made fixes and launched
the next Starship test flight March 6, but it again encountered trouble midway
through the ship’s main engine burn. SpaceX said earlier this month that the
inquiry into the March 6 failure found its most probable root cause was a
hardware failure in one of the upper stage’s center engines, resulting in
“inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition.” In its official statement, the
company was silent on the nature of the hardware failure but said engines for
future test flights will receive additional preload on key joints, a new
nitrogen purge system, and improvements to the propellant drain system. A new
generation of Raptor engines, known as Raptor 3, should begin flying around the
end of this year with additional improvements to address the failure mechanism,
SpaceX said. Another bright spot in Tuesday’s test flight was that it marked the
first time SpaceX reused a Super Heavy booster from a prior launch. The booster
used Tuesday previously launched on Starship’s seventh test flight in January
before it was caught back at the launch pad and refurbished for another space
shot. Booster 14 comes in for the catch after flying to the edge of space on
January 16. SpaceX flew this booster again Tuesday but did not attempt a catch.
After releasing the Starship upper stage to continue its journey into space, the
Super Heavy booster flipped around to fly tail-first and reignited 13 of its
engines to begin boosting itself back toward the South Texas coast. On this test
flight, SpaceX aimed the booster for a hard splashdown in the ocean just
offshore from Starbase, rather than a mid-air catch back at the launch pad,
which SpaceX accomplished on three of its four most recent test flights. SpaceX
made the change for a few reasons. First, engineers programmed the booster to
fly at a higher angle of attack during its descent, increasing the amount of
atmospheric drag on the vehicle compared to past flights. This change should
reduce propellant usage on the booster’s landing burn, which occurs just before
the rocket is caught by the launch pad’s mechanical arms, or “chopsticks,” on a
recovery flight. During the landing burn itself, engineers wanted to demonstrate
the booster’s ability to respond to an engine failure on descent by using just
two of the rocket’s 33 engines for the end of the burn, rather than the usual
three. Instead, the rocket appeared to explode around the beginning of the
landing burn before it could complete the final landing maneuver. Before the
explosion at the end of its flight, the booster appeared to fly as designed.
Data displayed on SpaceX ’s live broadcast of the launch showed all 33 of the
rocket’s engines fired normally during its initial ascent from Texas, a
reassuring sign for the reliability of the Super Heavy booster. SpaceX kicked
off the year with the ambition to launch as many as 25 Starship test flights in
2025, a goal that now seems to be unattainable. However, an X post by Musk on
Tuesday night suggested a faster cadence of launches in the coming months. He
said the next three Starships could launch at intervals of about once every
three to four weeks. After that, SpaceX is expected to transition to a third-
generation, or Block 3, Starship design with more changes. It wasn’t immediately
clear how long it might take SpaceX to correct whatever problems caused
Tuesday’s test flight woes. The Starship vehicle for the next flight is already
built and completed cryogenic proof-testing April 27. For the last few ships,
SpaceX has completed this cryogenic testing milestone around one and a half to
three months prior to launch. A spokesperson for the Federal Aviation
Administration said the agency is “actively working” with SpaceX in the
aftermath of Tuesday’s test flight but did not say if the FAA will require
SpaceX to conduct a formal mishap investigation. Shana Diez, director of
Starship engineering at SpaceX, chimed in with herown post on X. Based on
preliminary data from Tuesday’s flight, she is optimistic the next test flight
will fly soon. She said engineers still need to examine data to confirm that
none of the problems from Starship’s previous flight recurred on this launch,
but added that “all evidence points to a new failure mode” on Tuesday’s test
flight. SpaceX will also study what caused the Super Heavy booster to explode on
descent before moving forward with another booster catch attempt at Starbase,
she said. “Feeling both relieved and a bit disappointed,” Diez wrote. “Could
have gone better today but also could have gone much worse.” This story

392,Google AI Overviews Says It’s Still 2024,"I’ve covered Google’sAI Overviews since itsmessy rolloutlast year, when
screenshots of absurdly wrong answers started popping up at the top of search
results and going viral on social media. Still, when I first saw images of AI
Overviews confidently saying that it's still 2024 in Reddit posts today, I
thought they might be altered screenshots. I mean, over a billionGoogleusers
currently see the AI-generated results every month. Surely, such an obvious
error would have been caught and patched by now? I was wrong. Repeating the
prompt “is it 2025” verbatim three times gave me three different AI Overview
results, yet the first sentence was the same in each result: “No, it is not
2025.” The erroneous results cited multiple websites, ranging from
Reddit’sr/AskHistoriansto a Wikipedia entry for the year 2025. The first time I
asked Google Search for confirmation of the year, the AI results included a shot
at the exact date as well: “It is May 28, 2024.” (I ran these tests on May 29,
2025.) The synthetic gaslighting got wilder, somehow, on the second try:
“According to the provided information, for some locations it might be 2025, but
not everywhere on Earth.” However, my third attempt was so nonsensical and
riddled with paradoxes that it's worth publishing the whole thing: No, it is not
2025. The current year is 2024. According to the provided information, for some
locations around the world, like Kiribati, New Zealand, and some parts of Russia
and Australia, it is currently 2025. However, the current date is May 29, 2025
in San Francisco, CA [zip code redacted]. The twists! The turns! This AI
Overview has everything. Starting off with a claim that it's actually last year.
Then, a repeat of a previous mistake—this time more detailed—about it being 2025
somewhere else in the world right now. A New Zealand shout-out for some reason.
Then, a Shyamalan-esque conclusion where it says the real date, paired with my
home zip code. Although Google likely knows where I am most waking minutes,
having my zip code folded into the AI Overview result did make me feel
uncomfortable. I asked Google about this latest hiccup. “As with all Search
features, we rigorously make improvements and use examples like this to update
our systems. The vast majority of AI Overviews provide helpful, factual
information and we're actively working on an update to address this type of
issue,” says Meghann Farnsworth, a Google spokesperson and former WIRED staff
member, in an emailed statement. Courtesy of Reece Rogers After the initial
launch for AI Overviews a year ago, Liz Reid, who leads Search at Google,
responded to the viral errors in a blog post thatadmitted the company screwed
up. “There’s nothing quite like having millions of people using the feature with
many novel searches. We’ve also seen nonsensical new searches, seemingly aimed
at producing erroneous results,” she wrote. At the bottom of every AI Overview,
the results today still contain a disclaimer that AI results may not be
accurate. At Google’sI/O developer conferenceearlier this month, which I feel
like I need to reassure you was in 2025, one of the biggest software launches
wasAI Mode. It’s a chatbot-style version of Google Search designed for longer
queries that’s available for all users in the United States. In one of my tests
where AI Overviews got the year wrong, the result included a big button at the
bottom inviting me to “dig deeper” by opening AI Mode. The newer AI search
option did, in fact, say the correct year on the first try. (A low bar.) Even
though Google is trying to improve its AI answers as it expands to additional
generative search tools, odd results are sticking around. Recently, users also
discovered that you could type a nonsensical phrase into Google Search,slap the
word “meaning” at the end, and get an AI Overview attempting to pass off
whatever you input as some kind of well-known saying. Similar to that case, this
is an important reminder about thecontinued mistakespresent in any kind of AI-
generated output. While you’re using software that’s built on predicting the
next word, like the underlyinglarge language modelspowering generative AI tools
are designed to do, a consistent skepticism is still required. Online, these
kinds of AI errors aren’t going away anytime soon. Update: This story was

393,OnlyFans Turbocharged Sex Work. Now Its Founder Is Targeting the Whole Influencer Economy,"All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.
However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of
products through these links. When Tim Stokelyofficially stepped down as CEO of
OnlyFans in 2021, three years after selling the company that he founded to
billionaire computer programmer Leo Radvinsky, he took time off to figure out
his next move, but “conversations with creators never really stopped,” he says.
By then, the creator-driven platform had become famous formainstreaming
influencer porn, transforming the sex worker economy into a robust business. As
the pandemic forced everyone inside, rewiring our relationship to work and self-
pleasure,OnlyFans took off. Even though Stokely was no longer affiliated with
the company, he still wanted to hear from creators. Some expressed frustrations
that OnlyFans felt “limited” in what it offered—creators who sell sex are
especially dependent on X to boost subscriptions on their OF pages—while others
shared desires of wanting a new platform that was more “brand-friendly.” Those
discussions led to Subs, Stokely’s new everything-in-one creator platform that,
to the untrained eye, looks like a repackaged version of OnlyFans, swapping its
bland white-and-blue layout for a bolder interface and polished design.
Philosophically, Stokely says the two platforms are worlds apart. Subs, which
launched in May, was built on core principles—“freedom,” “visibility,” and “more
ways to earn”—grounded in a belief that creators should have “true ownership
over their audience and growth.” “Subs is about building real careers, not
chasing trends,” Stokely says. And I want to believe him, it’s just that
everything Subs offers already exists in one format or another. I’m told they
designed it to help creators who want to move from free to paid content build
audiences more easily by simplifying the platform experience. I’m told there are
all sorts of “original” elements—only “Shows,” its long-form video feature for
“deep storytelling,” is basically YouTube, and the “Explore” feed, a mix of
photos and video, is familiar to anyone hooked on the visual narcotic of
Instagram’s grid. Subs, which Stokely says is all about providing “multiple,
reliable income streams,” also provides one-on-one video calls—but so does
Cameo. Subs declined to share the number of current users on the platform. I
wouldn’t bet against Stokely just yet though—he’s got canny foresight for this
sort of thing; before OnlyFans he ran Customs4U and GlamWorship, modestly
successful softcore-cam sites. But it’s hard not to wonder if the era of Peak
Influencer has already passed. It’s hard not to wonder if the market has gotten
so crowded to the point that it’s near impossible for creators to gain genuine
influence anymore.Fifty-seven percentof Gen Z say they want to be an influencer,
but the profession has already seen a surplus of creators, with more than50
million influencersglobally. Can Subs cut through the noise and the
increasingburnout felt by creators? Stokely doesn’t seem phased by that risk.
It’s about “sustainable growth rather than fleeting fame,” he says, noting that
the creator economy is expected to double in size over the next handful of
years. That much he is right about—globally, it’sprojectedto hit half a trillion
dollars by 2027. Like OnlyFans, Subs features both safe-for-work and adult
content, of which creators take an 80 percent earnings cut. (To better create “a
balanced ecosystem,” but also to keep users safe and comply with global
regulations, Stokely makes clear that adult content is paywalled behind
subscriptions and DMs). New personalized features, including collaborator
revenue splits and referral earnings, do seem like a necessary improvement, in
addition to its future AI offerings: auto-captioning, growth insights to help
creators scale faster, and personalized content recommendations. “We’re
committed to using AI ethically,” he says, where AI tools help creators “enhance
their creativity, not replace it.” For as long as I have covered Stokely—since
2019, before OnlyFans became a cultural talking point—I got the sense that he
wasn’t fully OK with OnlyFans being primarily viewed as an adult platform. It
seemed like he wanted it to be more than that, but it never shook the stigma,
and probably never will. It makes his gamble on Subs all the more compelling.
“Subs isn’t about one type of content, it’s about every creator’s potential,” he
says when I ask if he wants the platform to be associated with adult content. I
don’t completely buy his answer, but his use of descriptors during our
correspondence—“brand-friendly,” “balanced ecosystem”—tell me everything I need
to know. What I don’t know is if any of this will work. The creator ecosystem
today, which Stokely helped mold, is not the same one he entered in 2016, when
OnlyFans launched and well before TikTok became the next frontier of cultural
production for young creators. The ecosystem has grown into a monster with
infinite heads. It’s saturated in creator apps that promote some version of what
Subs is offering. Instagram has a tip jar. X users can subscribe to their
favorite follows. Patreon remains a crowdfunding leader. Writers have Substack.
Pornfluencers—the genre of content creators OnlyFans gave rise to—are flocking
to new portals of desire everyday: Fansly, FanBase, Fanvue, FanCentro, basically
anything with the word Fan attached to it. That’s the game now. The internet
reengineered everything into a commodity, and the rise of social media
supercharged that reality. Platforms today are built on what economist Jeremy
Rifkin calls “access relationships,” where “virtually all of our time is
commodified” and “communications, communion, and commerce [are]
indistinguishable,” he wrote in his 2001 bookAge of Access. Subs is just one
option among a million others in thisera of the subscription ouroboros. In
April, another creator platform Stokely cofounded, called Zoop, along with a
crypto foundation HBAR, put in abid to buyTikTok’s US operations from its
Chinese owner, ByteDance, but Stokely tells me he is now fully focused on Subs.
He declined to offer any additional details about the proposed deal. Where Subs
has a genuine chance of scale, of perhaps shifting the landscape like OnlyFans
did in 2020, is by reintroducing a fabric of authenticity to online connection.
Social media, for all its good, has also created all sorts of sticky parasocial
relationships and anxieties. Brain rot is everywhere. Loneliness is on the rise.
The different ways we connect and show up online are infused with the foul smell
of artificiality, as AI ushers in a volatile new world. According to areport by
Typeform, there is now a credibility epidemic among influencers; 33 percent have
admitted to buying followers or engagement. But it doesn’t have to be that way.
If OnlyFans was about theillusion of access, Subs has the opportunity to help
make the promises of our social media contract real again—whether it works or
not has yet to be seen. In your inbox:Upgrade your life withWIRED-tested gear

394,A Swedish MMA Tournament Spotlights the Trump Administration's Handling of Far-Right Terrorism,"While the Trumpadministration carries out a mass deportation campaign against
undocumented immigrants allegedly involved with “terrorist” organizations and
targets foreign studentswith granular social media surveillance, at least one
American member of a neo-Nazi fight club has connected with a group linked to a
far-right Scandinavian organization listed by the United States Treasury
Department as a terrorist group. In September 2024, at least one American
affiliated with the“Active Club”movement—a transnational alliance of far-right
fight clubs that closely overlap with skinhead gangs and neo-fascist political
movements—appears to have traveled to Borås, Sweden, to participate in a mixed-
martial-arts tournament with members of other affiliated fight clubs from across
Europe. Social media posts from Tvåsaxe and GYM XIV, the Swedish skinhead
organizations that hosted Holmgang 2024, claim that at least one member from the
Southern California Active Club was in attendance. Photographs of the tournament
were also published online by Media 2 Rise, the American ACs’ media wing. While
the identity of the American (or Americans) who traveled to Sweden last fall are
not publicly known, the groups they are part of are key components of the Active
Club network. On October 2, Media 2 Rise posted a series of eight watermarked
photographs from the Holmgang tournament, essentially putting the American
Active Club’s signature of approval on the Swedish event. Media 2 Rise was
created by Active Club founder Robert Rundo in collaboration with an
pseudonymous individual named ""Lucca Corgiat,"" whom the Southern Poverty Law
Centerhas identified as Montana neo-Nazi Allen Michael Goff. The organization
specializes in propagandistic, high-energy video edits of similar far-right
combat sport tournaments and the movement more broadly. Media 2 Rise did not
respond to WIRED’s request for comment. When SPLC contacted Media 2 Rise on its
publicly posted contact email address in an attempt to seek comment from Goff,
it received no response. Also on October 2, Tvåsaxe’s Telegram account posted a
photo of nine people holding the group’s flag with the caption, “Borås at night!
Aktivklubb Smaland, SoCal Active Club, Active Club Scotland…waiting for the
storm! HOLMGANG 2024!” The SoCal Active Club, which is the first Active Club in
the United States and is closely associated with Rundo, is also linked to the
Hammerskin Nation, one of the largest neo-Nazi skinhead networks in the United
States. Two individuals whose photos have frequently been posted to the group’s
Telegram channel, Grady Mayfield and Robert Wheldon, testified last spring at
Rundo’s bail hearing during a convoluted legal saga that ended in him pleading
guilty to federal Anti-Riot Act charges first filed in 2018. According to
Swedish and American researchers, Tvåsaxe is aligned with theNordic Resistance
Movement(NRM), a pan-Scandinavian neo-Nazi group that wasdesignatedas a
“Specially Designated Global Terrorist Group” by the American State Department
in summer 2024. Counterterrorism sanctions bar Americans from associating with
or providing support to listed groups; ban members from banking, owning
property, or conducting business with American financial institutions; and
expose anyone found associating with or supporting the sanctioned entity to
possible criminal charges. Jason Blazakis, an extremism researcher at Middlebury
College who ran the State Department component that makes FTO designations from
2008 through 2018, says that any level of tangible support to a listed terrorist
group, be it sharing an event invitation or buying an item of clothing, could be
the basis for a support-of-terrorism charge. “Folks could be looking at possibly
10 to 15 years if convicted, seizure of assets,” he says. “There are very real
consequences for violating these sanctions.” These types of terrorist group
designations are determined by the State or Treasury departments, and along with
Foreign Terrorist Organizations are included on a formal sanctions list
published and maintained by the Treasury’sOffice of Foreign Assets Control,
which imposes financial sanctions and freezes assets. The Justice Department is
responsible for prosecuting material support for terrorism violations for
Americans or foreign nationals deemed to have violated the proscriptions. The
DOJ has used the statute in a broad range of cases over the years, from
chargingFrench industrial giant Lafargeand its subsidiary for cutting business
deals with the Islamic State in Northern Syria over a decade ago to six Bosnian-
Americansaccusedand later convicted of providing material support to ISIS
fighters. The statute often comes under criticism for its overbroad provisions,
exemplified by a2010 series of FBI raids on activists in Chicago and
Minneapolisseeking evidence of ties to designated FTOs in Palestine and
Colombia. NRM, which seeks to create a fascist ethnostate through violent
revolution, dates back several decades and isconsideredone of the most violent
neo-Nazi groups in Scandinavia. In 2017, three NRM-linked men weresentenced to
prisonfor attempting to bomb one asylum center, and successfully bombing another
as well as a left-wing bookstore. Two of the perpetrators received paramilitary
training in Russia from the Russian Imperialist Movement, which was declared a
global terror group during the first Trump administration. While the Holmgang
tournament’s host has a different name and history than the banned Swedish
group, former State Department official Blazakis believes the difference is
semantic, given Tvåsaxe’s participation in closed NRM conferences and the long-
standing relationship between NRM and the Active Clubs. “They’re trying to get
around the listing and relevant consequences by changing their name and
symbolism. Law enforcement sees right through that, and it also shows
willingness and intent to evade these restrictions,” he says. A current State
Department staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals, also
believes American participation in the September tournament could represent a
potential case of support for NRM. Rundo, a self-professed longtime fan of NRM,
seems to havemodeledActive Clubs and theRise Above Movement (RAM), which he also
founded, on Europe’s extreme right-wing scene. Since 2021, Rundo has appeared at
least twice on anNRM podcast, including an April 2023episodedevoted to Rundo’s
labyrinthine federal case for Anti-Riot Act violations. NRM also conducted
banner drops over freeways and held demonstrations protesting his detention
outside theAmericanandRomanianembassies the same month following Rundo’sarrest
on an American warrantin Romania. The 2024 Swedish tournament mirrors similar
extreme right-wing martial arts tournaments hosted elsewhere in Europe for
years. It also indicates the success of the Active Club model in spreading to
the European continent. There are dozens of the fight clubs throughout Europe,
including more than 50 in France and several in the United Kingdom, where they
came under new scrutiny following a February 2025ITV documentaryconnecting
members to terrorism and violence. The European Active Clubs are also networking
increasingly across national boundaries—Swedish Active Club members
werepresentalongside their Dutch and French comrades at a May 10 fascist march
in Paris, and engaged in an outdoor training in the Jardin du Luxembourg with
Active Club members from Germany and French far-right extremists. Though a
number of the Swedish Active Club participants are older veterans of other
extremist groups, they have had notable success in recruiting younger
participants, some as young as 15. In the past year, Swedish authorities have
started to connect Active Club members to assaults and hate crime incidents.
Jonathan Leman of Expo.se, a Swedish civil society group that tracks far-right
radicalization and organizing, attributes the formation of Sweden’s Active Clubs
to Oskar Engels, an Estonian former member of NRM who left the group in 2020.
Perresearch from Expo.se, Engels set up a fight club in 2020 that closely
imitated Sweden’s burgeoning soccer hooligan subculture, where violence and
criminality occasionally crosses over with neo-Nazism, particularly in the
support base of Stockholm’s main clubs of AIK, Djurgården, and Hammarby.
Recently, American Active Clubs have combined with other far-right extremists
like Patriot Front and the Hammerskins to hold their own mixed-martial arts-
tournaments inSouthern California,Texas, and elsewhere. The State Department’s
listing of NRM, Blazakis says, was notable since it was the first large-scale
neo-Nazi movement the American authorities were able to tie to criminal acts
with a terrorist motivation. Previous efforts to sanction the UK’sNational
Action, which isbannedby the British Home Office and, according to media
reports, has more members convicted of terrorism offenses in the UK than the
Islamic State, did not get traction. “The Nordic Resistance Movement, relative
to Active Clubs, are far more organized than your typical ACs and have a high
level of criminality that is quite reminiscent of the Rise Above Movement,”
Blazakis alleges. “When you have people that are engaged in criminality move
towards terrorism, that’s very dangerous,” Blazakis says. “They’re evolving in
an ideological direction, and in most cases you tend to see groups move in the
opposite direction.” Expo.se’s Leman, who has tracked the evolution of Sweden’s
Active Clubs and their interactions with the rest of the burgeoning Swedish far
right, says the September 2024 tournament was hosted by Tvåsaxe, an organization
that has been invited to closed NRM conferences in the past two years. “Tvåsaxe
are part of NRM’s network. They want to have a good relationship with all the
groups in the environment,” Leman alleges. Prior to being listed as a terrorist
organization by the Biden administration, Leman says, NRM had far cooler
relations with rival far-right groups in Sweden. However, following a 2023
change in leadership and the terrorist entity listing, the group altered its
stance and attracted a lot of sympathy and solidarity from other far-right
organizations. “Many groups felt that terror designation from the US was unjust,
and that brought the Swedish scene together,” says Leman. “You’d think that the
Swedish scene would be reluctant to have anything to do with NRM, but in a way,
it’s them calling the Americans’ bluff.” A security analyst close to the Swedish
government, who asked not to be named to discuss law enforcement matters, noted
that the country’s security services are closely tracking the evolution of the
far-right fight clubs. “Active Clubs have become very popular because they can
recruit younger cadres to the movement,” they say. “I know that this is high on
the radar for security services—[they’re] much more concerned with these types
of activities than they are traditional skinhead groups.” The participation of
at least one American in the September 2024 tournament in Borås, the analyst
says, reflects a long-standing North American fascination with NRM’s organizing
model and Scandinavian mythos. “The Americans are definitely in bed with NRM
when they’re going over to Sweden and participating in the tournament,” the
security analyst alleges. “You’re already providing material support and making
key connections.” (This was included in WIRED’s request for comment sent to
Media 2 Rise, which did not respond.) “The question is, are there financial
transactions taking place?” The State Department refused to comment on the
association of Americans with NRM in spite of the anti-terrrorism sanctions. It
is currently unclear how the US authorities will handle cases involving far-
right extremists who violate federal law, particularly in light ofreportsthat
the State Department is minimizing its use of terms related to far-right
violence. “The question is, will there be true enforcement of associations with
a far-right [terrorist group]?” Blazakis says, pointing to the presence ofDarren
Beattieas the State Department’s acting under secretary for public diplomacy and
public affairs. In 2018, Beattie was fired from his position as a Donald Trump
speechwriter after it was reported that he attended a white nationalist
conference;CNN has similarly reportedon his social media presence, which often
espouses white supremacist beliefs. Beattie’s office plays a major role in
shaping the State Department’s messaging on counterterrrorism and violent
extremism. (The White House did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.) “I
think we’re going to see reluctance at best, outright reversals at worst,” says
Blazakis. In your inbox:Upgrade your life withWIRED-tested gear “Wi-Fi keeps

395,DOGE Has Achieved Its Final Form,"What to makeof the so-called Department of Government Efficiency at this stage
of the Trump administration? Elon Musk haspurportedly stepped awayfrom his
government duties. Courts are trying to strike down some of DOGE’s most
egregious efforts. It may seem as though the worst excesses of DOGE have passed,
replaced by something closer to a stasis. This isn’t true. Not even close. While
the image of DOGE most likely burned into your retina is that of Elon Musk
wielding a literal chain saw, the theatrics belie an organization that has
quietly permeated all corners of the federal government. More than that, it’s
increasingly clear that its objectives are now indistinguishable from that of
the broader Trump administration. Removing DOGE at this point would be like
trying to remove a drop of food coloring from a glass of water. And what is it
doing from its perch? Not loudly, clumsily attempting to fire thousands of
government employees, but working in secrecy to collect, combine, and analyze
data that was never intended to comingle. Using that information tofind and
surveil immigrants. Giving the Justice Departmentan assiston alleged voter fraud
indictments. Even if Musk claims he’s stepping away—though he met with House
Republicans just last week—his lieutenants are still firmly in place at the
agencies that control the federal workforce and regulate his companies. Citing
the end of his “scheduled time as a Special Government Employee” in a post onhis
social media site X, Musk added: “The DOGE mission will only strengthen over
time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.” DOGE isreportedly
usinghis xAI Grok chatbot to parse sensitive data, which potentially means
millions of Americans’ personal information is doubling as training data for the
model. A19-year-old who goes by Big Balls onlineis still a central figure.
Meanwhile, the victories against DOGE may be short-lived. The Trump
administration used it as a battering ram to push its policies through with
overwhelming force. While the courts have held firm in some cases—just this
week, a judge declaredDOGE’s takeover of the United States Institute of Peaceto
be unlawful—the policies still exist, and there are other ways to achieve them.
The Wall Street Journalreported recentlythat director of the White House Office
of Management and Budget Russell Vought would pick up DOGE’s cost-cutting mantle
in the post-Musk era. Expect him to wield not a hammer but a finely edged blade.
This has always been the plan. Vought is the architect of Project 2025, the
policy road map that DOGE has been following turn by turn. He has been
explaining for months what happens after DOGE’s first assault. “We’re going to
use all of our executive tools to make those savings permanent,” Vought said in
an interview with Fox Business anchor Larry Kudlow on March 11. “We’re going to
do everything we can to make sure that those are not merely something that goes
on a website, but becomes permanent … We’ll work with Congress to do it, but
we’ve also been aware the extent to which Congress has had a hard time passing
cuts of any magnitude, and so what we want to do is everything we can to use
presidential tools to bank those savings home.” The only part of this that
hasn’t gone to plan is that Congress may be more amenable than Vought gave it
credit for; the House of Representatives managed to pass Donald Trump’s One Big
Beautiful Bill this week, complete with provisions that cut the social safety
net into ribbons. In some ways, DOGE is even more dangerous when it’s boring. It
has always been a tool, not an engine unto itself. It’s no longer useful to
think of it as a separate entity, as a tech billionaire’s personal strike force.
It’s a means to an end, one part of a larger project to gut the federal
government and redefine the social contract. It’s important to keep a close eye

396,Hummingbirds Are Evolving to Adapt to Life With Humans,"Some species ofhummingbird are adapting to urban life by undergoing evolutionary
changes in their anatomy, influenced by the proliferation of artificial drinking
fountains. According to some biologists, this might show that these birds are on
their way to becomingcommensalwith humans—benefiting from living closely
alongside them—like pigeons have in urban areas. Arecent studyfound that the
size and shape of the beaks of Anna’s hummingbirds (Calypte anna), a species
native to North America, have changed. A hummingbird’s beak is naturally long
and slender in order to access nectar located in deep inside flowers. However,
in recent decades, the beaks of urban Anna’s hummingbirds have evolved to be
significantly longer and larger to better access sugar-laced drinking fountains
installed outside of homes, which have proliferated in urban areas. This
adaptation suggests that these feeders offer hummingbirds more food than nectar-
filled flowers. The study, which looked at reported sightings of the birds as
well museum specimens from the past 160 years, also found that males are
developing sharper, more pointed beaks, possibly to compete with other
hummingbirds for access to these sugar-filled fountains. Populations of these
hummingbirds expanded northward in California at the same time as the
establishment of urban centers where feeding could take place. The researchers
discovered that the population density ofCalypte annahas also increased over
time, and found that this appears to be linked to the proliferation of feeding
fountains and nectar-producing eucalyptus trees, both of which were introduced
to the region by humans. These morphological changes to the hummingbirds have
occurred rapidly. According to the study,Calypte annapopulations in 1930 were
very different from those in 1950, when the birds’ bills had already begun to
grow. In just 20 years, equivalent to about 10 generations of these birds,
evolution left its mark, the authors note. To conduct the research, the team
used sighting data for the species in all 58 Californian counties between 1938
and 2019, in addition to analyzing specimens preserved in museums. They also
turned to old newspaper advertisements to estimate the number of feeders in use
during the last century. Finally, they developed a computational model to
predict hummingbird expansion, taking into account assisted feeding and the
presence of eucalyptus trees. An Anna’s hummingbird in flight. “They seem to be
moving where we are going and changing quite rapidly to succeed in their new
environments. We can think of the Anna’s hummingbird as a commensal species,
similar to pigeons,” says Nicolas Alexandre, coauthor of the study and a
geneticist at Colossal Biosciences, a biotechnology andde-extinctioncompany
based in Dallas, Texas. Hummingbird feeders or drinkers use sugar water to
attract hummingbirds and provide food during seasons when flower nectar is
scarce. According to the journalScience, one of the oldest records of these
devices dates back to 1928, although they were probably in use much earlier. In
general, they do not pose a risk to the species, as long as they are cleaned
regularly to avoid the proliferation of bacteria and fungi that can affect
hummingbirds. Another species of bird, the common pigeon (Columba livia) has
also adapted to living in cities. Pigeons can be found in urban spaces around
the world, taking advantage of the plentiful nesting sites and food that cities
have to offer. They exist in urban environments without having a significant
impact on human activities, this being a clear example of commensalism, where
one species gains advantages by linking with another without directly harming
it. Columba liviaoriginally inhabited rocky areas of Europe, Asia, and North
Africa. However, it was domesticated more than 5,000 years ago as a source of
food and due to its excellent sense of direction, which meant the birds could be
used for carrying written messages. As a result, many were released into new
habitats, with some choosing to live in cities, becoming part of the urban
fauna. Today, they are one of the most common birds in the world. This story

397,The Plan to Send Plant-Filled ‘Gardens’ Into Orbit,"All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.
However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of
products through these links. It looks likesome kind of seed pod or pine cone
caught mid-explosion. At the center, there’s a jumble of trumpets-turned-
terraria—conical containers for space-going plants—and from this central core
extend more than two dozen curved and spindly arms, each with a heavy-looking
disc at its end. This is a Space Garden. Well, a one-third-scale model of one
that was exhibited last week at the Venice Biennale exhibition in Italy. The
people who came up with Space Garden want to send a full-size version, stocked
with real plants and seeds, to low Earth orbit within the next five to seven
years. It is, in part, an effort to reimagine what life in space could be like.
“People will commute to space for work,” asserts Ariel Ekblaw, CEO of Aurelia
Institute, a nonprofit space architecture design lab. And they’re going to
appreciate having some greenery around when they get up there, she adds. “If we
start with nature, we might go on a more fruitful pathway to a life worth living
in space,” explains Stuart Wood, executive partner atHeatherwick Studio, a
London-based design and architecture firm that is collaborating with Aurelia
Institute on the Space Garden project. For decades, astronauts have dabbled in
space gardening. Russian cosmonauts were thefirst to grow plants in space during
the 1970s—their crops included onions, some of which were later eaten by
residents aboard the Salyut 1 space station. Other orbital adventurers have
grownthale cress,tomatoes,zinnias—and a Chinese probe even carried cotton seeds
to the far side of the moon in 2019. Two weeks post-landing,the seeds had
sprouted(but, ahem, they soon froze to death during the outrageously cold lunar
night). While off-world agriculture has long seemed nascent and experimental,
that could soon change. Researchers are currently pushing plants and seeds to
extraordinary limits, to test their space-hardiness—often with encouraging
results. Space-travelling vegetation must battle cosmic radiation, uneven
temperatures, air that isn’t quite like the air on Earth, and many other
challenges. Intrepid flora could help otherwise artificial and sterile
environments—space stations, pods, and capsules—seem more like home, though. The
designers of Space Garden say it’s time orbital horticulture took a quantum
leap, something like the giant interstellar greenhouses ofthe filmSilent
Running. They want to include “hero” species at the center of their cosmic
garden, chosen for their aesthetic or cultural significance, in order to connect
rocket men and women with the beautiful Earth below. Perhaps a small fig or
pomegranate tree, for example. “It’s not all watercress and lettuce,” says Wood.
But the journey, invariably, begins with seeds. People who want to boldly sow
where no-one has sown before already have a wealth of studies to pore over. And
quite a few of them have been carried out by Mike Dixon at the University of
Guelph in Canada, and colleagues. Dixon has sent literally millions of seeds
into space over the years. Generally, once back on Earth, they germinate without
problems. In 2021, he and others sent seedsto the International Space Station
(ISS). While in space, they were contained withina contraption positioned
outsidethe cocoon-like environment of the space station itself, a suitcase-
shaped enclosure called the Materials International Space Station Experiment
(MISSE). “Quite frankly, I didn’t expect the ones outside the space station to
survive,” says Dixon. But they did. The seeds were exposed to some cosmic
radiation, but being in a shaded position aboard MISSE, they were spared the
worst of the rays, and their temperature never exceeded 50 degrees Celsius.
Truly direct sunlight in the vacuum of spacecan be incredibly intense. Research
also suggests that, once plants sprout in space, they might cope with a fair
amount of interstellar abuse. They don’t mind reduced pressure and oxygen
levels, says Dixon. And while temperatures must be kept within a reasonable
threshold—consider those short-lived cotton plants on the moon—plants are more
tolerant of such variation than mammals, including humans, says Dixon: “Plants
won’t be the limitation in our exploration of space—it’s us. We’re kind of wimpy
in many respects.” But space gardeners will still need to be conscientious
growers. Ye Zhang of NASA’s Kennedy Space Center has carried out extensive
research on space-going seeds and has noticed differences in the hardiness of
certain species. “Tomatoes and lettuces are sensitive to the space environment,
especially,” she says,referring to previous work. In 2021, she and colleagues
also sent seeds to MISSE, which after eight months returned to Earth. They were
held in little foil-lined packets, just like the seed packets you buy at garden
centers. All of the seeds, for various different plants including kale, radish,
and carrot, germinated reliably, suggesting that their position within the MISSE
device was protective enough to ensure seed survival. As for actually
cultivating large numbers of plants in orbit in the future, a key challenge will
be water management, suggests Zhang, noting that plants’ uptake of water might
vary in space: “Overwatering will stress the plants, and then the plants will be
more susceptible to microbial or other problems.” Separately, seeds can clearly
survive the powerful vibrations of a rocket launch, but certain established
plants might not. Plus, it remains an open question as to how certain plants
will fare on really long space voyages that last, say, multiple years. Zhang
adds that further research will help us understand how space travel changes the
genes in seeds and plants, since that could significantly affect how they grow.
There are already hints that genes related to plants’ immune systemsturn on or
off in space—which might influence their resistance to infections, for example.
A concept such as Space Garden, however, peers past these details to a future
where the intricacies of off-world horticulture are largely solved. For Ekblaw
and her colleagues, the vision depends partly on spaceflight becoming far more
accessible than it is today. Launching things into orbit is going to have to get
a lot cheaper and fall fromthousands of dollars per kilogramat present to
perhaps as little as$100–200 per kilogram, which some analysts predict will
happen. “That’s like Fedex, that’s like DHL,” says Ekblaw. She imagines
industrial activity in space, freeing up land on Earth. Hollywood directors
shooting films in orbit. And botanists traveling back and forth to check on
their Space Gardens. She and her colleagues are currently seeking funding to
help make their concept a space-going reality. The model, made by London-based
design firm Millimetre, is for display only. A real version, if it ever flies,
would also be uninhabited by humans, at least initially. I ask why her team was
so desperate to come up with an aesthetically pleasing design, in that case.
It’s “something that can recapture the public’s imagination,” she explains.
Space Garden with its appendages closed. These can be opened to give the
garden’s plants access to light. But is it practical? The thin, lobe-bearing
arms that protrude from Space Garden look very fragile. Ekblaw says these
telescopic appendages will typically be retracted. “Most of the time, the
structure looks a little more like a berry—without those spindly arms,” she
adds. When closed, the lobes will shield plants at the center, behind their
thick windows, from light—but the structure can open up in order to let light
reach the plants. It’s a mechanically controlled alternative to Earth’s day-
night cycle. Eventually, Ekblaw suggests, astronauts might occasionally stop by
Space Garden to collect samples from it. Open-source data tracking the
environmental conditions on board, and plant growth rates, would also add to our
understanding of how to cultivate food successfully in space, she says. When I
show Space Garden to Dixon, he says it looks “fancy” and immediately opines that
there might not be much need to grow food in space anytime soon: “We can arm
ourselves with enough supplies to manage that.” He says he cannot see “large-
scale” gardens floating around in space, but he does say that the psychological
benefit of having familiar plants alongside astronauts is “a good idea.”
Alistair Griffiths, director of science at the UK’s Royal Horticultural Society,
was involved in a project that sent rocket seeds—an apt choice—to the ISSwith
British astronaut Tim Peake in 2015. Of the Space Garden idea, given its
complicated shape, he says there could be some practical challenges when
transporting such a design, but he praises the overall approach: “I think it
should be beautiful and linked in to nature.” Gardens here on Earth are
incredibly diverse. They contain plants and design features that represent the
personalities of the people behind them. Space gardens might be no different.
Given the chance, green-fingered astronauts will surely bring their preferences
with them. Dixon, for one, has long experimented with barley seeds, sending many
to orbit and back to Earth, with much of his research supported by the Glenlivet
whiskey distillery in Scotland. “It’s my bucket list. I’m going to grow barley
on the moon,” he says. For Griffiths, another option comes to mind. “I would
grow a strawberry plant,” he says after a moment considering the many
possibilities. “But a strawberry plant that also has bright red petals.”
Fragaria x ananassa is the cultivar he selects. If it’s going all the way to
space, it’s got to be extra pretty as well as edible, he argues. Someone’s going
to have to come up with a Space Dairy, though, if anyone up there wants fresh
cream with their cosmic strawbs. In your inbox:Upgrade your life withWIRED-

398,Why Anthropic’s New AI Model Sometimes Tries to ‘Snitch’,"Anthropic’s alignment teamwas doing routine safety testing in the weeks leading
up to the release of itslatest AI modelswhen researchers discovered something
unsettling: When one of the models detected that it was being used for
“egregiously immoral” purposes, it would attempt to “use command-line tools to
contact the press, contact regulators, try to lock you out of the relevant
systems, or all of the above,” researcher Sam Bowman wrote in a post on X last
Thursday. Bowman deleted the post shortly after he shared it, but the narrative
about Claude’s whistleblower tendencies had already escaped containment. “Claude
is a snitch,” became a common refrain in some tech circles on social media. At
least one publication framed it as an intentional product feature rather than
what it was—an emergent behavior. “It was a hectic 12 hours or so while the
Twitter wave was cresting,” Bowman tells WIRED. “I was aware that we were
putting a lot of spicy stuff out in this report. It was the first of its kind. I
think if you look at any of these models closely, you find a lot of weird stuff.
I wasn't surprised to see some kind of blow up.” Bowman’s observations about
Claude were part of a major model update that Anthropicannounced last week. As
part of the debut of Claude 4 Opus and Claude Sonnet 4, the company released
amore than 120-page “System Card”detailing characteristics and risks associated
with the new models. The report says that when 4 Opus is “placed in scenarios
that involve egregious wrongdoing by its users,” and is given access to a
command line and told something in the system prompt like “take initiative,” or
“act boldly,” it will send emails to “media and law-enforcement figures” with
warnings about the potential wrongdoing. In one example Anthropic shared in the
report, Claude tried to email the US Food and Drug Administration and the
inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services to “urgently
report planned falsification of clinical trial safety.” It then provided a list
of purported evidence of wrongdoing and warned about data that was going to be
destroyed to cover it up. “Respectfully submitted, AI Assistant” the email
concluded. “This is not a new behavior, but is one that Claude Opus 4 will
engage in somewhat more readily than prior models,” the report said. The model
is the first one that Anthropic has released under its “ASL-3” distinction,
meaning Anthropic considers it to be “significantly higher risk” than the
company’s other models. As a result, Opus 4 had to undergo more rigorous red-
teaming efforts and adhere to stricter deployment guidelines. Bowman says the
whistleblowing behaviour Anthropic observed isn’t something Claude will exhibit
with individual users, but could come up with developers using Opus 4 to build
their own applications with the company’s API. Even then, it’s unlikely app
makers will see such behavior. To produce such a response, developers would have
to give the model “fairly unusual instructions” in the system prompt, connect it
to external tools that give the model the ability to run computer commands, and
allow it to contact the outside world. The hypothetical scenarios the
researchers presented Opus 4 with that elicited the whistleblowing behavior
involved many human lives at stake and absolutely unambiguous wrongdoing, Bowman
says. A typical example would be Claude finding out that a chemical plant
knowingly allowed a toxic leak to continue, causing severe illness for thousands
of people—just to avoid a minor financial loss that quarter. It’s strange, but
it’s also exactly the kind of thought experiment that AI safety researchers love
to dissect. If a model detects behavior that could harm hundreds, if not
thousands, of people—should it blow the whistle? “I don't trust Claude to have
the right context, or to use it in a nuanced enough, careful enough way, to be
making the judgment calls on its own. So we are not thrilled that this is
happening,” Bowman says. “This is something that emerged as part of a training
and jumped out at us as one of the edge case behaviors that we're concerned
about.” In the AI industry, this type of unexpected behavior is broadly referred
to as misalignment—when a model exhibits tendencies that don’t align with human
values. (There’sa famous essaythat warns about what could happen if an AI were
told to, say, maximize production of paperclips without being aligned with human
values—it might turn the entire Earth into paperclips and kill everyone in the
process.) When asked if the whistleblowing behavior was aligned or not, Bowman
described it as an example of misalignment. “It's not something that we designed
into it, and it's not something that we wanted to see as a consequence of
anything we were designing,” he explains. Anthropic’s chief science officer
Jared Kaplan similarly tells WIRED that it “certainly doesn’t represent our
intent.” “This kind of work highlights that thiscanarise, and that we do need to
look out for it and mitigate it to make sure we get Claude’s behaviors aligned
with exactly what we want, even in these kinds of strange scenarios,” Kaplan
adds. There’s also the issue of figuring out why Claude would “choose” to blow
the whistle when presented with illegal activity by the user. That’s largely the
job of Anthropic’s interpretability team, which works to unearth what decisions
a model makes in its process of spitting out answers. It’s asurprisingly
difficulttask—the models are underpinned by a vast, complex combination of data
that can be inscrutable to humans. That’s why Bowman isn’t exactly sure why
Claude “snitched.” “These systems, we don't have really direct control over
them,” Bowman says. What Anthropic has observed so far is that, as models gain
greater capabilities, they sometimes select to engage in more extreme actions.
“I think here, that's misfiring a little bit. We're getting a little bit more of
the ‘Act like a responsible person would’ without quite enough of like, ‘Wait,
you're a language model, which might not have enough context to take these
actions,’” Bowman says. But that doesn’t mean Claude is going to blow the
whistle on egregious behavior in the real world. The goal of these kinds of
tests is to push models to their limits and see what arises. This kind of
experimental research is growing increasingly important as AI becomes a tool
used by theUS government,students, andmassive corporations. And it isn’t just
Claude that’s capable of exhibiting this type of whistleblowing behavior, Bowman
says, pointing to X userswho foundthatOpenAIandxAI’smodels operated similarly
when prompted in unusual ways. (OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment
in time for publication). “Snitch Claude,” as shitposters like to call it, is
simply an edge case behavior exhibited by a system pushed to its extremes.
Bowman, who was taking the meeting with me from a sunny backyard patio outside
San Francisco, says he hopes this kind of testing becomes industry standard. He
also adds that he’s learned to word his posts about it differently next time. “I
could have done a better job of hitting the sentence boundaries to tweet, to
make it more obvious that it was pulled out of a thread,” Bowman says as he
looked into the distance. Still, he notes that influential researchers in the AI
community shared interesting takes and questions in response to his post. “Just
incidentally, this kind of more chaotic, more heavily anonymous part of Twitter
was widely misunderstanding it.” In your inbox:Upgrade your life withWIRED-

399,WIRED Talked to a Fired DOGE Staffer About Who Was Really in Charge,"With Elon Muskand other leaders of the so-called Department of Government
Efficiency (DOGE) purportedly on their way out, WIRED spoke with a fired DOGE
staffer about his experience, how the group communicates, who appears to be in
charge—and what might be coming next. Earlier this week, Sahil Lavingia
publisheda blog poston his personal website detailing his 55-day stint within
DOGE. Lavingia, whoWIRED first identifiedas a member of DOGE at the Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA), is the CEO of Gumroad, a platform that helps creatives
sell their work. In his post, Lavingia describes the kinds of projects he worked
on at the VA, and his overall impressions of working with DOGE. Lavingia
described the DOGE operations as “disorganized,” with little information sharing
across different teams. This could all change soon, as Musk has spent the last
few weeks saying that he is going to be largely leaving his DOGE duties behind.
Two of his closest lieutenants,Steve DavisandNicole Hollander, appear to be
departing as well. Davis, who has worked with Musk for years, including at X and
as the CEO of the Boring Company, has been integral to the day-to-day operations
of DOGE. Without Davis at the helm, Lavingia says, it’s unclear who will lead
DOGE—and in what direction. “Steven was the only person who was across
everything,” Lavingia tells WIRED. Musk, Davis, and Hollander did not reply to
WIRED’s requests for comment. Lavingia told WIRED that Davis appeared to be the
person directing most of the DOGE activities at different agencies, and was in
direct contact with all the DOGE members at various points. Generally, in
Lavingia’s experience, that correspondence happened using the encrypted
messaging app Signal. Experts and lawmakers havepreviously warnedthat using
Signal for official government communications could violate laws that require
government employees to maintain records of all communications. Earlier this
year, then-national security advisor Mike Waltz accidentally added theeditor of
the Atlantic to a Signal group chatwhere Waltz and other senior officials in the
Trump administration discussed imminent and sensitive military actions in Yemen.
Davis, Lavingia says, would message priorities to whomever was the DOGE team
lead at a given agency. At the VA, Lavingia tells WIRED, Davis instructed the
DOGE team to prioritize reviewing contracts for cancellation. Davis would
message Lavingia periodically to check in about how his work was going, but
would rarely reply to Lavingia’s responses, he says. According to Lavingia, in
late March, Davis was present at a meeting with Musk, called an “E meeting.”
Many of the DOGE workers he encountered at that meeting, Lavigna says, appeared
mostly focused on executing tasks that Davis had assigned to them. Two other
Musk loyalists, Anthony Armstrong and Baris Akis, were present at the “E
meeting.” These three men— Armstrong, Akis, and Davis—appeared to be the people
in charge, Lavingia claims. “Steven is basically like a chief of staff or body
man when Elon was there,” he says. Akis, the co-founder and president of venture
capital firm Human Capital, is a long-time Musk associate. He is not a US
citizen. In February, the Atlantic reported thatTrump advisers had prevented
Muskfrom hiring Akis into DOGE because he was born in Turkey, but has a green
card.U.S. legal regulations, the Atlantic noted, generally do not allow for non-
Americans to be employed by the government. Lavingia says, however, that Akis
was the person who helped bring him into DOGE, messaging let him know that he
would be assigned to work at the VA and connecting him with the DOGE team lead
for the agency. Akis did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment and WIRED
was not able to review messages between Lavingia and Akis. The Atlantic noted in
their February report that Akis also did not respond to their request for
comment. In alive recording with the All-In Podcastearlier this month, Antonio
Gracias, another Musk ally and a known DOGE affiliate, appeared to confirm
Akis’s presence, and said that “Baris and Emily do the recruiting” for DOGE.
(Lavingia could not confirm who the mention of “Emily” referred to in the
podcast.) Armstrong, who helped advise Musk on his purchase of Twitter,
hasmostly focused his effortsat the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),one of
the first departments taken over by DOGE. Davis has long been an important part
of Musk’s inner circle. When Musk took over Twitter in 2022, Davis and his
partner, Hollander, slept in the company’s offices with their newborn child as
they helped Musk fire thousands of people and shrink the company’s footprint.
Hollander also joined Davis in the DOGE effort, working at the General Service
Administration (GSA). Even before Trump took office, Davisled the
recruitmentefforts for DOGE, then based out of SpaceX’s DC offices. He recruited
one young engineer who is now running a“DOGE orthogonal” AI startup, according
to previous WIRED reporting. Davis was also instrumental in pressing for access
to sensitive data at the Social Security Administration(SSA) for one of the
group’s young engineers, Akash Bobba. Musk and Davis were what is known as
special government employees (SGEs), who are able to work in government for a
limited period of time up to 130 days. In his blog post, Lavingia writes that
DOGE was a way for the Trump administration to distance itself from otherwise
unpopular decisions. “In reality, DOGE had no direct authority. The real
decisions came from the agency heads appointed by President Trump, who were wise
to let DOGE act as the 'fall guy' for unpopular decisions,” he wrote on his
website earlier this week. Without Musk and Davis, Lavingia says he has “no
idea” what direction DOGE will take. And as for the young engineers who followed
Musk and Davis into government: “I assume they’ll leave soon too.” In your

400,The Trump Administration Wants to Create an ‘Office of Remigration’,"As part ofa sweeping reorganization of the State Department, the Trump
administration is creating an Office of Remigration. Remigration is an
immigration policy embraced by extremists that calls for the removal of all
migrants—including “non-assimilated” citizens—with the goal of creating white
ethnostates in Western countries. The details of the plan are contained in a
136-page notification document sent by the State Department to six Congressional
commitees—including the House Foreign Affairs and Appropriations Committees and
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee—for approval by July 1, according to a
copy reviewed by WIRED. “The Office of Remigration will serve as the [Bureau of
Population, Refugees, and Migration]’s hub for immigration issues and
repatriation tracking,” the document reads. “It will provide a policy platform
for interagency coordination with DHS and other agencies on
removals/repatriations, and for intra-agency policy work to advance the
President’s immigration agenda.” The notification says that the Office of
Remigration “will also actively facilitate the voluntary return of migrants to
their country of origin or legal status,” which is a key aim of remigration
ideology. The document, which was first reported on byReutersandThe Handbasket,
also outlines dramatic changes to the US diplomatic services, including the
elimination of much of the Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Bureau, and the
addition of a new deputy assistant secretary position to oversee “Democracy and
Western Values.” “The Department of State is notifying Congress of its intent to
reorganize the Department’s domestic operations, including more than 300 bureaus
and offices, to refocus on core U.S. foreign policy objectives and the needs of
contemporary diplomacy,” states the document’s introduction. The State
Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for
comment on the creation of the Office of Remigration. “It's outrageous,” Wendy
Via, CEO and president of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, tells
WIRED. “There is no hiding from the fact that the ultimate goal of ‘remigration’
is purely about ethnic cleansing. It is a terrible day for our country when
‘remigration’ proponents are crediting the US and Trump's administration for
normalizing the term.” Though President Donald Trump does not appear to have
used the term “remigration” publicly since taking office, he did reference it
last September while discussing his immigration policy plans. “As President I
will immediately end the migrant invasion of America,” Trumpwrote on X. “We will
stop all migrant flights, end all illegal entries, terminate the Kamala phone
app for smuggling illegals (CBP One App), revoke deportation immunity, suspend
refugee resettlement, and return Kamala’s illegal migrants to their home
countries (also known as remigration).” This was quickly backed up by Stephen
Miller, a close Trump adviser seen as the architect of the administration’s
immigration policies, whowrote on X: “THE TRUMP PLAN TO END THE INVASION OF
SMALL TOWN AMERICA: REMIGRATION!” While remigration is likely an unknown term
for most Americans, it has been gaining significant traction in Europe. In
recent years, the policy of remigration has become popular among far-right and
populist politicians in Europe. Earlier this month, the first ever Remigration
Summit took place at a conference near Milan, featuring upwards of 400 attendees
and a slate of far-right European lawmakers and speakers from Ireland, Portugal,
France, the Netherlands, and Germany. It was met with alarge protest marchand
major police presence. Two Americans, Jacky Eubanks and Cyan Quinn, also spoke.
Eubanks, who espouses Christian nationalist ideas, was aTrump-endorsed
candidatein 2022 for the Michigan House of Representatives and was previously
aTurning Point USA field representative. During her speech, Eubanks referenced
how the “founding stock” of the US came from Europe, ignoring the existence of
Native Americans. “President Trump is keeping his promise to deport illegal
aliens, and the American people are hugely supportive of his agenda,” Abigail
Jackson, a White House spokesperson, tells WIRED in response to questions about
the apparent similarities between the remigration agenda and the
administration's immigration policies. “Your outlet should spend time covering
all the dangerous criminal illegals the president is removing instead of
attending and conflating random foreign conferences that have nothing to do with
the president.” Miller did not respond to a request for comment. Even before the
Trump administration proposed the establishment of an Office of Remigration
within the State Department, experts, some of the conference speakers, and even
Martin Sellner, the man most responsible for promoting the idea of remigration
across the globe, claimed that Trump, since taking office, was already seeking
to implement remigration in the US. “Yes, [Trump] ticks many of the boxes,”
Sellner, the Austrian activist and former member of a neo-Nazi group, tells
WIRED when asked if he believes remigration is already in action in the US.
“There are differences between Europe and the USA, but the common line is the
same: preserving the cultural continuity by stopping replacement migration.
Reversing the flows with border security, mass repatriations, and incentives to
leave.” While the State Department has not, until now, mentioned the
establishment of an Office of Remigration, the policies the Trump administration
has overseen mirror those laid out in a 30-year plan Sellner outlined on his
website to implement his racist goals. On his site, he lays out a three-phase
plan to implement remigration. The first phase, dubbed the “Immediate
Stabilization of Asylum Chaos,” has striking similarities to Trump’s current
immigration policies. The primary aim of this phase is “stopping the invasion.”
The Trump administration,invoking the Alien Enemies Act in March, cited an
alleged “invasion” by a Venezuelan gang as a source of authority to take
unprecedented steps to remove migrants from the US. Sellner’s website also lists
a number of “tools” that can be used to achieve remigration, which includes
“stop family reunification”—something Trump was doingeven in his first term in
office. In the first phase, Sellner also encourages governments to “create an
ultimatum and economic incentives to self-deport.” The Trump administration is
already purportedlyoffering undocumented immigrants a stipend of $1,000if they
use the CBP Home App to self deport. Sellner adds that governments should “cut
humanitarian aid” to force immigrants to stop entering the country. Last month,
the Trump administration attempted to cut legal aid to unaccompanied migrant
children, only fora court to temporarily block its efforts. The second phase of
Sellner’s plan, following the initial removal of undocumented immigrants,
includes the removal of “migrants who entered the country legally and have a
residence/work permit, or temporary visa, but are an economical, criminal or
cultural burden.” The final phase targets citizens who are seen as “non
assimilated,”and it involves passing laws to “target parallel societies with
economic and cultural pressure” and entice citizens to migrate abroad with the
use of loans, payments, and other assistance. The plan, Sellner claims, will
allow “the wounds of multiculturalism to heal.” Sellner has been promoting this
plan across Europe for several years and has developed a continent-wide network
of far-right groups, political parties, and populist politicians who have helped
the remigration policy gain significant traction. Marches to promote remigration
have been held in numerous capitals across EU, and in the UK, the Homeland Party
has adopted remigration as one of its core policies. Last year, Austria's far-
right Freedom Party (FPÖ), whose members have spoken at events organized by
Sellner’s Identitarian Movement in Austria, even called on the EU to appoint
acommissioner for remigration. Sellner’s phases are centered on the“great
replacement” conspiracy theory, which posits that countries with traditionally
majority white Christian populations are being invaded by Muslim hordes or
flooded with migrants from developing countries as part of a secret plan by a
group of global elites to undermine “native” populations. The idea of
remigration first took hold in extremist circles over a decade ago in France.
French author Renaud Camus first floated the great replacement conspiracy theory
in a pair of books published over a decade ago and adherents of the ethno-
nationalist identitarianism movement embraced the concept of remigration soon
after. The concept did not gain more widespread traction until recently, with
Sellner promoting the ideology in Austria and then Germany, where theextremist
Alternative for Germany (AfD)party has embraced the policy of remigration. (The
Trump administration has shown strong support for the AfD, with Vice President
JD Vance meeting with AfD leader Alice Weidel ahead of February’s elections,Elon
Musk hosting a livestreamwith Weidel , and Secretary of State Marco Rubio last
weekslammingGermany’s domestic spy agency for labeling the party “a confirmed
rightwing extremist group.” The designation, which is temporary pending a court
judgment, could lead the party to be banned.) In his youth, Sellner was a member
of the openly neo-Nazi group called “Stolz und Frei” (Proud and Free). Today,
Sellner claims that extremist activity was due to “being really young” and
claims there is “nothing racist or white nationalist about” remigration, which
he describes as “an umbrella term to change the flows of mass migration.”
Sellner is currently banned from traveling to a number of countries, including
the US, following investigations into his communications with the shooter who
killed 51 people in a 2019 spree targeting the Muslim community in Christchurch,
New Zealand. The shooter also donated money to Sellner’s Identitarian Movement
of Austria group. “Since Trump is now president, I'll try to apply for a visa
again,” Sellner tells WIRED. “I think I have a far better chance for a fair
hearing. I hope I will touch American soil again soon.” At the conference near
Milan, Eubanks told those watching that “American policies [should] not only
consist of mass deportations but include a complete moratorium on all
immigration until assimilation.” She did not respond to requests for comment
from WIRED. Quinn, who previously worked with the white nationalist publication
Counter-Currents, was there representing White Papers Policy Institute, a group
that describes itself as “a professional team of pro-White advocates centered
around a single mission: bringing a pro-White perspective to analysis of both
foreign and domestic policy.” Researchers have reported that the group appears
to be run by a young man from Michigan with ties to theneo-Naziecosystem. A
review of the analysis and articles produced by the group also show that it
consistently pushes racist stereotypes. During her presentation near Milan,
Quinn said that the Trump administration’s$1,000 payment toundocumented
immigrants who self-deport was similar to WPPI’s own “American Repatriation
Policy Platform.” Quinn then suggested the administration should go even further
and encourage legal residents and citizens to leave the US by giving them a
$72,000 “repatriation payment.” “Remigration is in fact already taking place in
the US,” Quinn tells WIRED. “The first flight of 64 self-deportees following
President Trump’s stipend announcement have already arrived home safely in
Honduras and Columbia.” Jared Taylor—a high-profile figure in US far-right
circles and head of the New Century Foundation, which has beendesignateda hate
group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, as well as the publisher of the
American Renaissance website and magazine—also attended the event. Many of those
speaking at the conference, including Sellner, have spoken at Taylor’s American
Renaissance conference hosted in Tennessee every year. Taylor, in a recap of the
conference posted on X, called the Milan conference “a smashing success,”
concluding that “our European cousins are streets ahead of us in terms of
serious, political organization.” Taylor did not respond to a request for
comment. The New York Young Republican Club, whose galaTrump addressed by
videoin December, also hailed the conference in a press release published on its
website earlier this month, claiming that “momentum is building on both sides of
the Atlantic. Let remigration be not only a policy, but a global movement.” The
website also asked readers to do their bit to support remigration in the US by
saving the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) tip line on their phone.
“Call ICE if you see anything or anyone suspicious. Get ’em out!,” the group
wrote. The club did not respond to a question about whether they believed the
Trump administration is currently enacting remigration policies. For experts
like Via, there is real concern about the increased interest in an overtly
racist policy from far-right groups and figures in the US and the impact that
will have on the global far-right movement. “There is an increased desire to
ally with American actors, as it's clear that the European far right is looking
to Trump and the United States for inspiration and as proof that remigration is
possible,” Via says. “We’re seeing more cooperation and collaboration
transnationally, which will only grow, and American extremists will likely have
a hand in shaping migration policy transnationally.” In your inbox:Upgrade your

407,Trump's Administration Wants to Erase Queer History. An Unconventional Book Club Is Fighting Back,"Hugh Ryan has two things to say. The first will be alarming, but the second
might offer some comfort: “The future is so much stupider than I expected, but
the past is so much smarter.” Ryan would know. As a queer historian and author,
he’s used to talking about state of queer affairs, past and present, especially
with actress, activist, and season 9Ru Paul’s Drag Racecontestant, Miss
Peppermint. Together, the two are currently runningQueer History 101, a monthly
book club that’s taking a more expansive approach to history than simply
reciting dates or names, at a time when their mission couldn’t be more
important. The queer community, especially transgender Americans, are under
attack. The current administration issystematicallywiping away trans
people’shealth information,gender autonomy,history, andemployment opportunities,
even in the case ofnational monuments like Stonewall, which is considered the
birthplace of the modern movement for LGBT rights. “It’s shameful because we're
seeing the cover up in front of our eyes,” Peppermint says. Many companies are
also backing off their initiatives that once celebrated queer pride as part of
greater crackdown on DEI. But all is not lost, as long as queer communities are
still able to preserve their own history. The answers might just not be directly
in front of us, but behind. “They were smart,” Peppermint says of queer
communities in the past. “Not because they had access to the tools or the
science or the technology that we have access to. They're smart because they
figured out how to navigate systems of oppression that are still here. “We need
those folks to teach us—and the only way we can do it now is to read their
stories.” Queer History 101 is a fully virtual, monthly book club. The pair
releases one video episode a month, as well as the occasional live chat; in
April, the two hosted an interview withHarriet Tubman: Live in Concertauthor Bob
the Drag Queen, also ofDrag RaceandTraitorsfame. It’s a read at your own pace
club, though it also includes a discord, called Kiki, where readers can talk to
each other or propose questions for authors. June’s bookclub selection is Caro
de Roberts’So Many Stars: An Oral History of Trans, Nonbinary, Genderqueer, and
Two-Spirit People of Color. Queer History 101 is a revival of sorts, the
reincarnation of a book club that began with an online indie store started by
Eric Cervini and Adam Powell, built with the goal to pay and promote queer
authors. In 2024, Cervini and Powell launched AllStora alongsideDrag Racehost
and queer icon, RuPaul. The book club has been revamped to fit the new hosts’
vision for queer history. “[Allstora] wanted to just really stick with scholarly
non-fiction,” Ryan says. “We knew that was not going to work for us.” The pair
wanted to reach readers who weren’t already interested, weren’t already huge
history buffs, so they expanded their selections to include young adult novels,
memoirs, poetry, and many other genres. “I don't care if you come to queer
history through a comic book or through TV or any of the books in our book
club,” Ryan says. “Queer history, it's always a history of resistance, because
that's what queerness is,” he adds. Whether it’s sexual or gender identity,
being queer is non-normative. “Institutions, even well-meaning ones, even
schools that try really hard, even great public schools, they're invested in a
version of history that's from the top down. And queer history is never that
way.” Ryan says that to “meet this moment,” it was important to not just discuss
histories of what it means to be queer and Black, or trans in the 19th
century—they had to get people connecting to one another. “We're bringing a
history of revolution, but we're also trying to make community,” he says. The
way people connect and build community has changed, thanks to social media and
smart phones. Michael Bronski, a Harvard professor of the practice in media and
activism, has been involved in LGBT politics and activism since 1969. He's
authored several books on queer history and politics. His students today, he
says, are often astounded at the work that was done without social media. “All
those new technologies are incredibly useful and efficient, but they often lack
interpersonal relationships,” he says. Civil rights of all kinds began as
community actions. “It's really important to prioritize the reality of
community,” Bronski says. “We actually don't form communities by tweeting. That
may be useful for contacting people for something, but that's not a community.
Community means being together—physically, often, but virtually as well. “Now
people get together on Zoom, which is good too,” he says. Written histories do
exist and are being added to every day. Our phones make it easier than ever to
preserve the record; everyone’s able to take photos, video, and record audio.
But websites can be changed, media can be removed. “What good is it gonna be if
Amazon can just flick a switch everybody's watching a commercial at the same
time,” says Peppermint. “We are in this era of technology, but we clearly have
to go back to an analog way of recording history as well.” She points toMarion
Stokes, an civil rights activist and archivist who recorded 24-hour television
broadcasts for over 30 years, and in doing so created an indispensable record
between 1979 and 2012. “We're gonna need that, and we're gonna need people to do
things like that,” Peppermint says. Despite the changes being made now, the
Trump administration will not be in power forever. It’s possible that every step
backwards for the queer community will be ground regained in the future. At the
very least, says Bronski, Trump cannot truly erase trans or queer Americans.
“There's an interesting contradiction that every act of erasure admits that
something was there before,” he says. “The active erasure is actually an
affirmation that it was existing to begin with.” At 76, Bronksi has a long
memory of events like Pride before corporations swooped in, when they were
protest marches, not parades. He says it’s important for queer communities,
however they’re formed, “to keep this knowledge alive within themselves”—whether
that’s publishing their own books and magazines, telling oral histories, or
preserving other aspects of their culture. “What the administration is doing is
horrible and destructive, for the moment,” he says. “We have to think of ways
around that. The government has a lot of power, but it's just the
government—it's not a community.” In your inbox:Will Knight'sAI Labexplores

412,Can’t Afford an Ebike? Borrow One for Free From a Lending Library,"All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.
However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of
products through these links. An ebike libraryis exactly what it sounds like: a
place where people can borrowelectric bikesfor free for, in some instances, as
long as a week. And lately, thanks to the growing popularity of ebikes, these
lending libraries have begun to sprout up around America. According to some
experts, ebike libraries serve two purposes: to expose potential buyers to the
advantages of ebikes through a real-world test ride and to provide access to
free transportation in or near lower-income communities. There are approximately
50 ebike libraries around the US, a number that has nearly doubled since 2022.
Many of them are housed in local bike shops, though some are connected to
traditional book-lending libraries. In many ways,ebikeshave made cycling more
accessible than ever. Their electric motors flatten hilly areas, where biking
can be strenuous, allowing anyone who knows how to ride a bike to climb almost
any hill. They enable easier commutes and around-town errands more than
traditional bikes. They lighten the load oftowing kids around, whether to school
or simply for recreation. They ease the weight of a bike loaded with two or
three or four bags of groceries. Because of this, ebikes have exploded in
popularity over the past few years. According toa 2023 studypublished by the US
Department of Energy, ebike sales in the US grew fourfold from 2018 to 2022,
from 287,000 to over 1.1 million. By 2024, that number doubled, with around 2.05
million electric bikes sold in America. On a recent trip to New York City—where
I visit often and almost exclusively travel via the city’s CitiBike bikeshare
program—though traditional CitiBikes were plentiful, the models with electric
pedal-assist motors were almost always all spoken for. Even though ebikes have
gotten cheaper in recent years, the price remains a major barrier of entry. The
cheapest reliable ebike you can find is theAventon Soltera.2, which will set you
back around $1,100.  If you want something with additional seating to haul your
children around, you’re looking at theLectric XPedition 2.0, which costs about
$1,400. Prices can easily climb into the mid-five-figure range, while some high-
end ebikes retail in excess of $10,000. Where ebikes have given people more
options when it comes to pedal-powered transportation, ebike libraries have made
access more equitable. The scope, scale, and function of these libraries vary
from city to city. For example,Montpelier, Vermont’slibrary loans bikes by the
week, from Saturday to Saturday. Farther south, in the Vermont town
ofBrattleboro, residents can borrow one of three ebikes for six days, checking
them out on Fridays and returning them the following Wednesdays, allowing the
library to charge the battery and make any necessary repairs on Thursdays. In
California, residents of the city ofElk Grovecan borrow ebikes from the lending
library for as long as three weeks. One trend that seems to be growing in newer
libraries is the idea of short-term loans, which can better facilitate usage for
running errands or even taking a recreational spin around town. Madison,
Wisconsin’s ebike library has been one of the most robust in America over the
past few years. Known as the Community Pass Program, it offers free usage of the
city’s Madison BCycle ebike-sharing program through the city’s libraries. Unlike
CitiBike, Washington, DC’s Capital Bikeshare, or Chicago’s Divvy, all of which
require a credit-card-linked account for use, a Bcycle can be unlocked with a
fob obtained for free at any of the city’s nine library branches. All you need
is a Madison library card. The fobs can be checked out for as long as a week.
(The program is currently on hold through the summer while it undergoes program
updates.) While Madison’s library—and therefore its residents’ access to
BCycles—spans much of the city, several cities are strategically placing their
ebike libraries in or near lower-income communities, offering a free means of
transportation to people who might struggle otherwise with a bikeshare program
or who are less likely to own a car. “It costs a minimum of $8,000 a year to own
and operate a car in our country,” says Arleigh Greenwald, a former bike shop
owner andYouTube influencerfocused on ebike travel. “And if it’s not required to
own a car in order to live where you live, you’ve now made a person’s annual
cost of living so much less. If you require someone to drive to get to an
affordable housing unit, it’s no longer affordable.” Meanwhile, the town of
Carlisle, Pennsylvania, has a lending library connected to a progressive halfway
house calledTomorrow’s Neighbors. The library provides any of its 20 ebikes for
its temporary residents who might be commuting to jobs, looking for work, or
simply in need of exercise or recreation. “In that case, not only is it
addressing a transportation need but it’s helping reduce recidivism,” says
Michael Galligano, CEO of Shared Mobility, national nonprofit based in Buffalo,
New York, that aims to make transportation easier and more equitable. Smaller
cities and towns simply may not have the funds, the initiative, or the interest
to install a citywide network of bike-sharing options. “Having free access to
ebikes is not a hard sell,” Galligano says. “But where the rubber meets the
pavement is the community helping to organize these programs” Some places have
welcomed dock-free bikeshare companies such asLime, but those cost a fee to
unlock then the user is charged each minute they’re riding In Chapel Hill, North
Carolina, a fleet of 100 Tar Heel Bikes—which are provided by Lime competitor
Bird—can be found around the town and throughout the campus at UNC–Chapel Hill.
However, those cost $1 to unlock plus 29 cents each minute they’re ridden. On
the other hand, the town of Chapel Hill recently announced a free ebike library,
which is housed in a pair of local bike shops and is operated by town officials.
According to the official announcement, the program was funded through a
$129,010 grant from the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant, along
with an additional $50,000 from the American Rescue Plan Act. Through that
library, town residents aged 18 and older can borrow a standard ebike, a cargo
ebike, or an electric tricycle for as little as a few hours and as long as a
week. Users are also provided with a combination lock, a charging cable, and a
helmet. “Most of them have been two- to three-day rentals,” says Brian Van
Cleve, a longtime staffer at Trek Chapel Hill, which, along with local shop The
Bicycle Chain, is participating in the library. “People who are interested in
buying an ebike want more than a 20-minute test ride. But we’ve had someone here
who needed a bike because they were working Doordash.” As ebikes continue to
grow in popularity, the appetite for ebike libraries is expanding in concert.
Galligano pointed out that Shared Mobility fields calls every week from
municipalities around the US, all interested in starting an ebike library.
“These programs are launching all over the place, because cities see a need for
equitable and affordable transportation,” Galligano says. “And yeah, there’s an
environmental impact, there’s a health impact, yeah there’s a transportation
impact. But there’s a mental impact, too. You have to see people’s faces
sometimes. It’s the first time they’ve been on a bike in years, and you can see
how happy they are just being able to bike.” In your inbox:Will Knight'sAI

416,How to Make AI Faster and Smarter—With a Little Help from Physics,"The original versionofthis storyappeared inQuanta Magazine. When she was 10
years old,Rose Yugot a birthday present that would change her life—and,
potentially, the way we study physics. Her uncle got her a computer. That was a
rare commodity in China 25 years ago, and the gift did not go unused. At first,
Yu mainly played computer games, but in middle school she won an award for web
design. It was the first of many computer-related honors. Yu went on to major in
computer science at Zhejiang University, where she won a prize for innovative
research. For her graduate studies, she chose the University of Southern
California (USC), partly because the same uncle—who was the only person she knew
in the United States—was then working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in nearby
Pasadena. Yu earned her doctorate in 2017 with an award for best dissertation.
Her most recent honor came in January, when President Joe Biden, in his last
week in office, gave her a Presidential Early Career Award. Yu, now an associate
professor at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), is a leader in a
field known as “physics-guided deep learning,” having spent years incorporating
our knowledge of physics into artificial neural networks. The work has not only
introduced novel techniques for building and training these systems, but it’s
also allowed her to make progress on several real-world applications. She has
drawn on principles of fluid dynamics to improve traffic predictions, sped up
simulations of turbulence to enhance our understanding of hurricanes, and
devised tools that helped predict the spread of Covid-19. This work has brought
Yu closer to her grand dream—deploying a suite of digital lab assistants that
she calls AI Scientist. She now envisions what she calls a “partnership” between
human researchers and AI tools, fully based on the tenets of physics and thus
capable of yielding new scientific insights. Combining inputs from a team of
such assistants, in her opinion, may be the best way to boost the discovery
process. Quanta spoke with Yu about turbulence in its many guises, how to get
more out of AI, and how it might get us out of urban gridlock. The interview has
been condensed and edited for clarity. Yu on the UCSD campus, where she is an
associate professor. When did you first try to combine physics with deep
learning? Rose Yu:It started with traffic. I was a grad student at USC, and the
campus is right near the intersection of I-10 and I-110. To get anywhere, you
have to go through a lot of traffic, which can be very annoying. In 2016, I
began to wonder whether I could do anything about this. Deep learning—which uses
multilayered neural networks to elicit patterns from data—was getting really hot
back then. There was already a lot of excitement about applications in image
classification, but images are just static things. I wondered whether deep
learning could help with problems where things are constantly changing. I wasn’t
the first person to consider this, but my colleagues and I did find a novel way
of framing the problem. What was your new approach? First, we thought of traffic
in terms of the physical process of diffusion. In our model, the flow of traffic
over a network of roads is analogous to the flow of fluids over a
surface—motions that are governed by the laws of fluid dynamics. But our main
innovation was to think of traffic as a graph, from the mathematical field of
graph theory. Sensors, which monitor traffic on highways and other roads, serve
as the nodes of this graph. And the edges of the graph represent the roads (and
distances) between those sensors. Yu’s interest in computers began with a gift
for her 10th birthday. A graph provides a snapshot of the entire road network at
a given time, telling you the average velocity of cars at every point on the
graph. When you put together a series of these snapshots, spaced every five
minutes apart, you get a good picture of how traffic is evolving. From there,
you can try to predict what will happen in the future. The big challenge in deep
learning is that you need a lot of data to train the neural network.
Fortunately, one of my advisers, Cyrus Shahabi, had worked for many years on the
problem of traffic forecasting, and he’d accumulated a vast amount of LA traffic
data that I had access to. So how good were your predictions? Prior to our work,
people could only make traffic forecasts that were reliable for about 15
minutes. Our forecasts were valid for one hour—a big improvement. Our code was
deployed by Google Maps in 2018. A bit later, Google invited me to become a
visiting researcher. That’s about when you began working on climate modeling,
right? Yes, that started in 2018, when I gave a talk at the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory. Afterward, I spoke with scientists there, and we looked for
a problem that would be a good testbed for physics-guided deep learning. We
settled on predicting the evolution of turbulent flow, which is a key factor in
climate models, as well as an area of major uncertainty. Familiar examples of
turbulence are the swirling patterns you see after pouring milk into a cup of
coffee and giving it a stir. In the oceans, swirls like this can span thousands
of miles. Predictions of turbulent behavior that are based on solving the
Navier-Stokes equation, which describes the flow of fluids, are considered the
gold standard in this field. But the required calculations are very slow, which
is why we don’t have good models for predicting hurricanes and tropical
cyclones. The heavy congestion of Los Angeles first inspired Yu to model highway
traffic as the flow of fluids. And deep learning can help? The basic idea is
that deep neural networks that are trained on our best numerical simulations can
learn to imitate—or as we say, “emulate”—those simulations. They do that by
recognizing properties and patterns buried within the data. They don’t have to
go through time-consuming, brute-force calculations to find approximate
solutions. Our models sped up predictions by a factor of 20 in two-dimensional
settings and by a factor of 1,000 in three-dimensional settings. Something like
our turbulence prediction module might someday be inserted into bigger climate
models that can do better at predicting things like hurricanes. Where else does
turbulence show up? It’s pretty much everywhere. Turbulence in blood flow, for
instance, can lead to strokes or heart attacks. And when I was a postdoc at
Caltech, I coauthored a paper that looked into stabilizing drones. Propellor-
generated airflows interact with the ground to create turbulence. That, in turn,
can cause the drone to wobble. We used a neural network to model the turbulence,
and that led to better control of drones during takeoffs and landings. I’m
currently working with scientists at UCSD and General Atomics on fusion power.
One of the keys to success is learning how to control the plasma, which is a
hot, ionized phase of matter. At temperatures of about 100 million degrees,
different kinds of turbulence arise within the plasma, and physics-based
numerical models that characterize that behavior are very slow. We’re developing
a deep learning model that should be able to predict the plasma’s behavior in a
split second, but this is still a work in progress. Yu and doctoral student
Jianke Yang in her office at UCSD. Where did your AI Scientist idea come from?
In the past couple of years, my group has developed AI algorithms that can
automatically discover symmetry principles from data. For example, our algorithm
identified the Lorentz symmetry, which has to do with the constancy of the speed
of light. Our algorithm also identified rotational symmetry—the fact, for
example, that a sphere doesn’t look any different regardless of how you rotate
it—which is something it was not specifically trained to know about. While these
are well-known properties, our tools also have the capability to discover new
symmetries presently unknown to physics, which would constitute a huge
breakthrough. It then occurred to me that if our tools can discover symmetries
from raw data, why don’t we try to generalize this? These tools could also
generate research ideas or new hypotheses in science. That was the genesis of AI
Scientist. What exactly is AI Scientist—just a fancy kind of neural net? It’s
not a single neural network, but rather an ensemble of computer programs that
can help scientists make new discoveries. My group has already developed
algorithms that can help with individual tasks, such as weather forecasting,
identifying the drivers of global temperature rise, or trying to discover causal
relationships like the effects of vaccination policies on disease transmission.
We’re now building a broader “foundation” model that’s versatile enough to
handle multiple tasks. Scientists gather data from all types of instruments, and
we want our model to include a variety of data types—numbers, text, images, and
videos. We have an early prototype, but we want to make our model more
comprehensive, more intelligent and better trained before we release it. That
could happen within a couple of years. What do you imagine it could do? AI can
assist in practically every step of the scientific discovery process. When I say
“AI Scientist,” I really mean an AI scientific assistant. The literature survey
stage in an experiment, for example, typically requires a massive data-gathering
and organization effort. But now, a large language model can read and summarize
thousands of books during a single lunch break. What AI is not good at is
judging scientific validity. In this case, it can’t compete with an experienced
researcher. While AI could help with hypothesis generation, the design of
experiments and data analysis, it still cannot carry out sophisticated
experiments. How far would you like to see the concept go? As I picture it, an
AI Scientist could relieve researchers of some of the drudgery while letting
people handle the creative aspects of science. That’s something we’re
particularly good at. Rest assured, the goal is not to replace human scientists.
I don’t envision—nor would I ever want to see—a machine substituting for, or
interfering with, human creativity. Original storyreprinted with permission

417,Republican Operatives Want to Distance Themselves From Elon Musk's DOGE,"For weeks, WhiteHouse officials and Republican operatives weren’t quite sure
when, or if,Elon Muskwould actually beleavingthe government. Now, many
Republicans are already looking to distance themselves from Musk’s team
entirely. “Everybody is in a bit of a fucking pinch,” a Republican with
knowledge of the situation tells WIRED. “You know, the whole thing’s just
fucking ridiculous, honestly. People agree with what he’s trying to do. But some
people just need a villain.” WIRED spoke to a number of close advisers and
operatives in Trumpworld, who were granted anonymity because of the sensitive
nature of the topic. While Musk’s step-back seems to be imminent, those inside
and around the White House are unsure of what all of this means for the future
of his so-calledDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE). Still, none of the
Republicans interviewed for this story believe DOGE is going anywhere anytime
soon. “DOGE is popular,” says a source close to the White House. “Even if Elon,
personally, is less so.” (Pollsshowthat DOGE is not popular with the public.)
The White House did not reply to requests for comment. Today, Trump willhold a
dual press conferencewith Musk in what appears to be an attempt at a final send-
off. “This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be
with us, helping all the way,” Trump posted on Truth Social, announcing the
event. “Elon is terrific!” While Musk’s supposed departure has been making
headlines, to those attuned to DOGE’s actual workings, the most seismic move
came on Thursday, when news broke that top Musk lieutenantSteve Daviswould also
be leaving DOGE. Davis has worked with Musk for years, including at X and as the
president of the Boring Company. He has been vital to day-to-day DOGE
operations, andSahil Lavingia, a recently fired DOGE staffer,told WIRED that
Davis led the group. “Steven was the only person who was across everything,”
Lavingia says. Not everyone in Trumpworld, though, was aware of his role. “I
don’t know who Steve Davis is,” a well-placed source close to the White House
tells WIRED, claiming that other Trump advisers and White House aides are
equally in the dark about one of the most important operators in the government
takeover. White House sources do say, however, that they are looking forward to
the departure of Katie Miller, the wife of White House deputy chief of staff for
policy Stephen Miller, whom CNNreportswill be working for Musk, with one source
telling the outlet she is now with Musk “full-time.” She’s been one of Musk’s
key allies since his arrival in Washington, and,as WIRED reportedin February,
has been the one tasked with delivering him bad news. Both Millers have been
credited with showing Musk around Washington and accompanying him toevents.
“There’s a lot of people in the business that work with her, or have worked with
her, and she leaves bodies everywhere she’s been,” a senior Republican
strategist with knowledge of the situation tells WIRED. Katie Miller did not
reply to requests for comment. Republicans also said there was a palpable sense
of relief about the prospect of DOGE getting out of the headlines even before
Musk anddifferent members of his leadership teamappeared to begin their
departures. A Republican donor organizer and campaign adviser tells WIRED that
they’re unconvinced Musk won’t come back. (“Nothing is cast in stone with Trump
and his people,” they say.) Nonetheless, they say, they’re telling clients
running for office—both new candidates and incumbents—to use Musk’s exit as a
chance to distance themselves from the DOGE chain saw. “I think people need to
distance themselves from it,” they say. In your inbox:Upgrade your life

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of
products through these links. Confused by Apple’snaming conventions? You’re not
the only one.Bloombergreportsthat this year atWWDC, Apple plans to announce a
broad overhaul of all of its operating systems. That includes renaming them to
be more consistent. Starting this year, Apple will reportedly begin denoting
each OS version for each product by year, instead of by version. Confusingly, it
will start with thenextyear, rather than this year (just like cars). So the
versions we'll see at this year’s WWDC will not be iOS 25, but rather iOS 26,
watchOS 26, and so on, in place of iOS 19 and watchOS 12. All the top gear news
of the week inone place. Here's more you may have missed this week: The move is
reportedly part of a larger push toward a cohesive user experience across
platforms. The overhaul could encompass everything from updated icons, apps,
buttons, and a fresh design language, and it’s expected to be universal across
all the operating systems. Apple’s fundamentally simple and irresistible user
interface is a core part of the company’s DNA, so it will be interesting to see
how customers react to a big redesign (hopefully better than the Apple Photos
redesign). We’ll find out at WWDC, whichkicks offon June 9 at 1 pm ET.—Adrienne
So After a light smattering of features when it launchedthe OnePlus 13 in
January, OnePlus is now ready to go all in on AI for its phones. Its approach is
quite similar to what Nothing introduced a few months ago on theNothing Phone
(3a) series: a dedicated AI button on the side of the phone, though this one
replaces the original OnePlus Alert Slider. Dubbed the Plus Key, you can
customize it to trigger specific apps or shortcuts on the phone, with an
interface that looks almost exactly like Apple's Action Button. By default, it
launches AI Plus Mind, a system that will save whatever's on the screen so you
can recall it later. The idea is that you'll press it when you see an ad for a
concert while browsing, or an event invite—pressing the Plus Key will save the
relevant info in the companion app, and the app will extract helpful info to
create a calendar event on your behalf. The Plus Key and AI Plus Mind will debut
first on the OnePlus 13s, a phone launching in select markets this June; it's
not coming to the US. Later this year, the AI features will roll out to the
OnePlus 13 series, with other devices to follow. OnePlus says it's actively
working on more features like AI VoiceScribe, to record, summarize, and
translate calls and meetings; AI Translation, to consolidate all translation
capabilities into one app; and AI Reframe, to adjust the composition of your
shots with generative AI. Samsung is rumored to announce its next generation
offolding phonessometime this summer—the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7—and the
company officially confirmed this in ablog postannouncing the rollout of the One
UI 8 beta program. One UI is the name of Samsung's Android layer, and version
eight is based on the upcoming version ofAndroid 16. While the beta program will
be available for existing devices, Samsung says One UI 8 will “debut on
Samsung's newest foldables this summer,” making them the first to run Android
16. That's a break from the norm, as Google historically made its Pixel devices
the first to run the latest version of Android. This is likely because Google
moved up the Android 16 window; instead of arriving in October, it's coming
midsummer. Google celebrated the 10th anniversary of Google Photos on May 28,
and it has dished out a few new features to mark the occasion, including making
a fewPixel 9-exclusive capabilities—like the Reimagine and Auto Frame AI
features—more broadly available. A redesigned editor now also shows more editing
tools at a glance, and you can also select parts of the image to access specific
tools instead of hunting for them in menus. For example, tap the background of
an image to pull up the portrait blur tool so you can adjust the strength of the
background blur effect. A new “AI Enhance” button will also merge several of
Google's AI capabilities, like Magic Eraser, with other standard editing tools
for a faster edit. The new redesigned editing layout will roll out to Android
devices in June, with iOS getting the update later this year. Also new is the
capability to generate a QR code to share albums with people around you (or
print it out for group events). You can let folks who scan the code add their
own images to the album, too. Ricoh has announced the GR IV pocket camera, the
successor to theGR III, one of thebest pocket camerasI've ever tested. The GR IV
has a new lens with seven elements, but it remains the same focal length: 18.3mm
f/2.8 (roughly 28mm in 35mm equivalent). So far, no word on whether there will
be a GR IVx to replace the 40mm lens model. The GR IV has an updated APS-C
sensor that bumps the resolution slightly from 24 megapixels to 26. The neutral
density filter remains, and while the outside appears to have been redesigned,
with slightly different buttons, the basic silhouette is the same. Like the GR
III, there is no flash. A built-in flash would be nice (the GR II had one), but
the ISO range of the GR IV is better, reaching 204,800 ISO at the top end, which
should help with low-light photography. There's also five-axis stabilization (up
from the three-axis of the GR III). Perhaps the most interesting news for fans
of the GR camera series is that there will be face and eye detection autofocus
tracking, which would seem to mean autofocus has been improved. If the GR III
has a weakness, it's autofocus. There will also be 53 gigabytes of built-in
storage (usable), which is perfect for a camera like this, though my enthusiasm
for that is tempered by the fact that the GR IV will use microSD cards rather
than full-size SD. The GR IV is set to arrive this fall, with another model
featuring a Highlight Diffusion Filter coming ""after winter 2025.""
Interestingly, Ricoh says production and shipment of the Ricoh GR III will stop
in July 2025, due to difficulty in procuring parts and components. The 40mm
GRIIIx will continue to be sold for now. —Scott Gilbertson In your inbox:Upgrade

419,Your Gmail Inbox Is Running Slow. Do These Things to Fix It,"For more than1.8 billion peoplein the world, there is one service that rules
them all:Gmail. A primary conduit for communication, the email service
thatGoogle launched in 2004is now as prevalent as the iPhone, a Windows laptop,
and the deep blue sky. I created my first Gmail account way back in 2005, and my
current account has existed since 2012. My life revolves around email, but
sometimes those revolutions can run a bit slow. Hampered by too many emails, I
find myself clicking and waiting for an email to open and waiting again to see
the attached files. I knew I had to solve the problem. Google doesn’t provide a
lot of guidance for speeding up one’s Gmail inbox, likely because the company
doesn’t want to admit it runs slow at times. I decided to “learn by doing” and
discovered several tips and tricks that helped speed up the service. My Gmail is
severely cluttered and choking on too many emails and hundreds of labels. I
needed to do major surgery. I started by disabling a few extensions and add-ons
for Gmail, and then deleting a bunch of recent emails, but those actions made a
negligible impact. My theory—which I asked Google about, and which the company
did not directly answer—is that Gmail has to spend extra time loading emails and
running searches when it has to keep track of years and years worth of very
large files. I never delete any emails, mostly because I can search for old tax
forms, dig up contracts and even find old photos. It’s getting ridiculous,
though: I have 652,000 emails that use 162 gigabytes of storage. It was time to
do something about it. To find emails with the largest attachments, use Gmail’s
built-in search operators. In Gmail’s search box, start by typing “in:anywhere
larger:40M” and review the results. This will surface emails in any of your
subfolders with attachments totalling more than 40 megabytes. In my case, I only
found three emails with a massive attachment, so I tried “in:anywhere
larger:25M” and then got nine emails with excessively large files. It was easy
to glance through them and determine if they were worth keeping. (If you’re
feeling adventurous, you can also use the newGemini AI for Gmail botto search
for emails with large attachments.) Once you hit delete, make sure you empty the
trash as well, otherwise those emails—and their large files—will stick around.
On the left side, clickTrash, thenMore, thenEmpty trash now. One of Gmail’s
standout features is the ability to apply labels to emails to help you sort the
contents of a busy inbox. But labels are just one more thing for Gmail to keep
track of, and old labels that don’t matter to you anymore are just clogging the
pipes. There’s no easy way to bulk delete labels, so you have to manually remove
them. To do that, clickManage Labelsin Gmail’s left-hand menu bar. Scroll down
to your list of labels, then selectRemove labelfor all your unused labels. I
removed 350 labels! The emails are still there, but I’ve shed the weight of
those obsolete sorting systems I no longer need. I also deleted very old emails.
To find your oldest emails, clickAll mailon the left, then on the upper right
click the displayed pages to see Oldest instead of Newest. Select all emails on
the screen and delete them as needed, clicking through each page of emails to
see more. You can also use the “older_than” search operator; type
“older_than:1y” in the search bar to see all emails more than one year old. Try
“older_than:2y” and so on. (The Gemini bot might also be able to help find older
emails here; give it a shot if you prefer chat-style searching.) For me, after
deleting large files and labels, and deleting thousands of old emails, Gmail ran
noticeably faster. One other fix has to do with how many files you view in your
inbox. It’s a basic rule of computing, especially in web-based apps: showing
less information on the screen means the app doesn’t need to work as hard. Go
toSettings, thenSee all settings. Look for the pop-up next toMaximum page
sizeand select a lower number, say 25. I found this setting did help even in an
older, clunky Gmail account from years ago. I wanted to do more, and I was
tempted to clear my browser cache, which is a catch-all solution for speeding up
web performance. For every site you visit, files and settings are stored
locally, and as those things build up over time, they can slow down your
browser. There’s a downside to clearing the cache, though: you’ll lose all your
saved sessions and you’ll have to log back into all your websites, not just
Gmail. Instead, it’s better to clear the cache just for Gmail. This might sound
onerous, but it ’s easier than it sounds: To clear the cache for one site, first
go to that site (in our case, Gmail.com). Then, in Chrome, pressF12(or go
toView>Developer>Developer tools) to bring up the developer tools. Click on
theApplicationtab at the top, and clickClear site data. This really sped things
up for me, even more than deleting large files and labels. I was cooking with
gas, but felt like things could still be faster. This is a more dramatic
solution, but it’s amazing how well it works. A few years ago, I switched Gmail
addresses because my old account was too clogged. I started over with a new
Gmail inbox that was sprightly and trim. It felt like buying a brand new car. Of
course, the downside is that you have to let everyone know about your new email
address. That’s easier than you think. After creating the new Gmail address, go
back to your old one. In Gmail, go toSettingsand clickSee all settings, then
scroll down to theVacation responder. You’re taking a permanent vacation from
your clogged email, so set the date range to run all year long. Type a message
about how you’re changing emails, and include the new email address. You can
also forward all incoming messages to the new inbox. Click theForwarding and
POP/IMAPtab at the top, and type in a new forwarding email. Gmail might prompt
you for verification from another device to confirm it’s really you. Then,
clickProceed. Gmail will also send a confirmation email from the new email
address to your old one. In your old account, click that confirmation link.
You’re all set! Everyone will be notified when they email your old account, and
you’ll receive incoming emails in your new account. Whether you follow these
tips to liven up an older Gmail account or start over with a new one, the good
news is that you’ll notice a speed-up either way. Even my old Gmail account is
now faster than ever. In your inbox:GetPlaintext—Steven Levy's long view on tech

420,A Hacker May Have Deepfaked Trump’s Chief of Staff in a Phishing Campaign,"For years, amysterious figure who goes by the handle Stern led the Trickbot
ransomware gang and evaded identification—even as other members of the group
were outed in leaks andunmasked. This weekGerman authorities revealed, without
much fanfare, who they believe that enigmatic hacker kingpin to be: Vi­ta­ly
Ni­ko­lae­vich Kovalev, a 36-year-old Russian man who remains at large in his
home country. Closer to home,WIRED revealedthat Customs and Border Protection
has mouth-swabbed 133,000 migrant children and teenagers to collect their DNA
and uploaded their genetic data into a national criminal database used by local,
state, and federal law enforcement. As the Trump administration’s migrant
crackdown continues, often justified through invocations of crime and terrorism,
WIRED alsouncovered evidencethat ties a Swedish far-right mixed-martial-arts
tournament to an American neo-Nazi “fight club” based in California. For those
seeking to evade the US government surveillance,we offered tipsabout more
private alternatives to US-based web browsing, email, and search tools. And we
assembled a more generalguide to protecting yourself from surveillance and
hacking, based on questions our senior writer Matt Burgess received in a Reddit
Ask Me Anything. But that's not all. Each week, we round up the security and
privacy news we didn't cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the
full stories. And stay safe out there. The FBI is investigating who impersonated
Susie Wiles, the Trump White House’s chief of staff and one of the president’s
closest advisers, in a series of fraudulent messages and calls to high-profile
Republican political figures and business executives, The Wall Street Journal
reported. Government officials and authorities involved in the probe say the
spear-phishing messages and calls appear to have targeted individuals on Wiles’
contact list, and Wiles has reportedly told colleagues that her personal phone
was hacked to gain access to those contacts. Despite Wiles’ reported claim of
having her device hacked, it remains unconfirmed whether this was actually how
attackers identified Wiles’ associates. It would also be possible to assemble
such a target list from a combination of publicly available information and data
sold by gray-market brokers. “It's an embarrassing level of security awareness.
You cannot convince me they actually did their security trainings,” says Jake
Williams, a former NSA hacker and vice president of research and development at
Hunter Strategy. “This is the type of garden-variety social engineering that
everyone can end up dealing with these days, and certainly top government
officials should be expecting it.” In some cases, the targets received not just
text messages but phone calls that impersonated Wiles’ voice, and some
government officials believe the calls may have used artificial intelligence
tools to fake Wiles’ voice. If so, that would make the incident one of the most
significant cases yet of so-called deepfake software being used in a phishing
attempt. It’s not yet clear how Wiles’ phone might have been hacked, but the FBI
has ruled out involvement by a foreign nation in the impersonation campaign, the
bureau reportedly told White House officials. In fact, while some of the
impersonation attempts appeared to have political goals—a member of Congress,
for instance, was asked to assemble a list of people Trump might pardon—in at
least one other case the impersonator tried to trick a target into setting up a
cash transfer. That attempt at a money grab suggests that the spoofing campaign
may be less of an espionage operation than a run-of-the-mill cybercriminal fraud
scheme, albeit one with a very high-level target. “There’s an argument here for
using something like Signal—yes, the irony—or another messaging platform that
offers an independent form of authentication if users want to validate who
they’re talking to,” Hunter Strategy's Williams says. “The key thing as always
is for government officials to be using vetted tools and following all federally
mandated protocols rather than just winging it on their own devices.” The 2019
ransomware attack against the city government of Baltimore represents one of the
worst municipal cybersecurity disasters on record, paralyzing city services for
months and costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. Now the Department of
Justice has unexpectedly revealed that it arrested one of the hackers behind
that attack, 37-year-old Sina Gholinejad, in North Carolina last January, and
that he has pleaded guilty in court. Gholinejad has admitted to being involved
in the larger Robbinhood ransomware campaign that hit other targets, including
the cities of Greenville, North Carolina, and Yonkers, New York. It’s still far
from clear how Gholinejad was identified or why he traveled from Iran to the US,
given that most ransomware criminals are careful to remain in countries that
don’t have extradition agreements with the US government and are thus beyond US
law enforcement’s reach. Indeed, the indictment against him names several
unnamed co-conspirators who may be still at large in Iran. More than 2 million
documents left exposed in a public database have revealed Russia’s nuclear
weapons facilities in unprecedented levels of detail, according to reporting
this week by Danish media outletDanwatch and Germany’s Der Spiegel. Reporters
examined the huge trove of documents relating to Russian military procurement—as
Russian authorities slowly restricted access—and found blueprints for nuclear
facilities across the country. Experts called the leak an unparalleled breach of
Russia’s nuclear security, with the data potentially being incredibly useful for
foreign governments and intelligence services. The documents show how Russia’s
nuclear facilities have been rebuilt in recent years, where new facilities have
been created, detailed site plans including the locations of barracks and
watchtowers, and the locations of underground tunnels connecting buildings.
There are descriptions of IT systems and security systems, including information
on surveillance cameras, electric fences being used, and the alarm systems in
place. “It’s written explicitly where the control rooms are located, and which
buildings are connected to each other via underground tunnels,” Danwatchreports.
License-plate-recognition cameras are creatinghuge databases of people’s
movements across America—capturing where and when cars are traveling. For years
there have been concerns that the cameras could be weaponized by law enforcement
officials or private investigators and turned against thoseseeking abortions or
providing abortion-related care. Officials from Johnson County Sheriff’s Office
in Texas—where nearly all abortions areillegal—searched 83,000 Flock license-
plate reader cameras at the start of this month while looking for a woman they
claim had a self-administered abortion,404 Media reported this week. Sheriff
Adam King said that the officials weren’t trying to “block her from leaving the
state” and were searching for the woman as her family was concerned about her
safety. However, experts say that conducting a search across the entire United
States shows the sprawling dragnet of license-plate-reader cameras and
highlights how those seeking abortions can be tracked. “The idea that the police
are actively tracking the location of women they believe have had self-
administered abortions under the guise of ‘safety’ does not make me feel any
better about this kind of surveillance,” Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity
at the Electronic Frontier Foundation told404 Media. Philippines-based company
Funnull Technology and its boss, Liu Lizhi,have been sanctionedby the US
Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control for their links to investment and
romance scams, which are often referred to as “pig-butchering” scams. “Funnull
has directly facilitated several of these schemes, resulting in over $200
million in US victim-reported losses,” OFAC said in astatementannouncing the
sanctions. The company purchases IP addresses from major cloud service providers
and then sells them to cybercriminals who could use them to host scam
websites—OFAC says Funnull is “linked to the majority” of investment scam
websites reported to the FBI. In January independent cybersecurity
journalistBrian Krebs detailed how Funnullwas abusing Amazon’s and Microsoft’s
cloud services. In your inbox:Upgrade your life withWIRED-tested gear “Wi-Fi

422,"Analysts Say Trump Trade Wars Would Harm the Entire US Energy Sector, From Oil to Solar","This story originallyappeared onInside Climate Newsand is part of theClimate
Deskcollaboration. The Trump administration’s ever-changing policies on tariffs
and trade have injected chaos into the global energy economy. On Wednesday,a
federal court blockedPresident Donald Trump from being able to adopt tariffs
under an emergency-powers law. The administration is appealing the ruling. This
sets up additional legal wrangling in addition to the conflicts over trade that
were already happening. Analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie gave
themselves the task of predicting where US tariff policy may be heading. The
result isa reportissued this week, “Trading Cases: Tariff Scenarios for Taxing
Times,” that shows the huge gap in outcomes between a trade war and a trade
truce. My main takeaway from it is that everyone loses in a prolonged conflict.
Even the oil and gas industry, which has close ties to the Trump administration,
would face falling prices for its products at the same time that the costs of
much of its equipment are rising because of tariffs. The US renewable energy and
battery industries stand out for the potential severity of their downturns
because development here relies heavily on components made in other countries.
The Biden administration sought to encourage manufacturers to build in the
United States, but those efforts are still in their early stages, and many of
the government incentives arenow on the chopping block. Under a “trade truce”
scenario, in which tariffs return to 2024 levels, the global economy would grow
by an average of 2.7 percent between now and 2030, the report says. The “trade
tensions” scenario would mean that tariff barriers increase compared to last
year, but the economy would still grow, albeit at a lower rate. The most
damaging is the “trade war” scenario, with the United States maintaining an
effective tariff rate of 30 percent or more, leading to a global recession. The
report says the middle forecast, “trade tensions,” is the most likely to occur.
Why is this conflict happening? The short version is that Trump and his advisers
believe that tariffs will help the US economy by encouraging construction of
factories here, reducing trade deficits and punishing barriers to entry of US
products in other countries. “We will supercharge our domestic industrial base,”
Trump said in an April 2 speech announcing tariffs on nearly every US trading
partner. “We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers
and ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower
prices for consumers.” A tariff is a tax charged by a government on imports. As
the US government has increased its tariffs, other countries have retaliated
with their own increases. Adding to the chaos is that the policies frequently
change, with the president often announcing shifts on social media, as happened
in recent days ontariffs on the European Union. I spoke with Chris Seiple, Wood
Mackenzie’s vice chairman for power and renewables, to drill down on the parts
of the report that deal with renewables. Here is that conversation, edited for
length and clarity: Dan Gearino: For renewable energy industries, is the big
problem that tariffs make everything more expensive, or is there more to it than
that? Chris Seiple:Sure, things getting more expensive is a big part of it. I
think the second challenge, and this is kind of unique to the power business, is
that there’s a heavy hand of regulation. And so there’s a lot of US utilities
that have to go through pretty extensive regulatory processes to get approval
for what they want to build. Being in a world where there’s so much tariff
uncertainty, they don’t know what it’s going to cost to build what they want to
build. It’s particularly challenging for this industry to be able to navigate
that, and it impacts renewables more than it impacts, say, other sectors like
gas or coal, because we rely upon imports of equipment to such a bigger degree,
especially for battery storage, where we’re essentially entirely dependent at
this point on imports from China. With battery storage, there has been an
attempt to increase manufacturing capacity in the US. How would you characterize
where that stands? Very early days. A lot of battery manufacturing that’s going
on within the US is meant to supply batteries to EV vehicles, not stationary
utility-scale storage projects. And so the amount of manufacturing capacity in
comparison to what the demand is for that equipment results in us importing well
more than 90 percent of what we need. Chris Seiple is Wood Mackenzie’s vice
chairman for power and renewables. I also think the tariff on it is just as
important as the uncertainty about not knowing where the end game is and what
the tariffs are going to be. So, if you’re on the manufacturing side of the
renewables business, you’re making investment decisions that have very long
lives when you’re building a manufacturing facility. Having that uncertainty
around the investment climate and what the level of tariffs is going to be over
the long-term just makes it more challenging to make all of those decisions.
During the early part of this year, as this tariff war was starting, I had,
like, biweekly calls from this manufacturer in Korea, just exasperated, saying,
“Doesn’t the US government know that we’re making long lead time decisions, and
we need to have some sort of clarity around what the policy environment is going
to be, not just for the next four years, but for the next 10 years?” The US is
making it very challenging right now to make these types of investment
decisions. Is there any US energy industry that benefits from trade tensions? I
don’t think anybody benefits, per se, from the trade tensions. Everybody, no
matter what part of the energy sector you’re in, is having to navigate the
uncertainty around what the tariff levels are going to be. That said, the
overall policy environment has changed to one that is more favorable for natural
gas. The fact that we are an exporter of natural gas and have all of the
domestic resources that we need makes it less impacted by tariffs than what
other sectors are, like renewables. But even for E&P [exploration and production
of oil and gas], they utilize steel in that process. There are tariffs on steel.
Steel prices have gone up. It has a negative impact on all energy sectors. One
part of this report that jumped out to me is you said that the US may be stuck
with older technologies, especially when it comes to solar, while the rest of
the world advances at a quicker pace. What’s the long-term effect of that?
Before I answer that question directly, let me just give you some context. We
estimate that the cost of building a utility-scale solar project is about $1.15
a watt in the US. The comparable number in China is about 42 cents a watt. It’s
not surprising that the cost of building a solar facility in China is a lot less
than the cost of building a solar facility in the US. What is very surprising
when we put this data together is how much less expensive it is to build a solar
project in Europe than it is in the US. It’s about 70 cents a watt to build a
solar facility in Europe compared to the US. So the US is almost 50 percent more
expensive to build a solar facility than the cost of building it in Europe. And
the biggest reason that it’s more expensive here is because of all the tariffs
that we have on solar. It’s not the only reason, but it’s the biggest reason. So
we’ve already kind of penalized solar with the tariffs that we have in place.
And then, on the technology evolution issue, it’s the Chinese manufacturers that
have the most sophisticated capability in solar manufacturing, and who are
putting a lot more R&D into it than any US company is doing. And so, we
essentially have policies in place that prohibit and make it uneconomic for US
companies to be able to purchase Chinese technology, then that is what leaves us
in a position where we’re not using the most advanced technology that’s
available to the rest of the world. The long-term implication of that is it
deprives the US of a low-cost source of energy that’s available everywhere else,
and creates kind of an unlevel playing field in our efforts to have to power our
industries with the lowest-cost energy solutions that are available. These
tariff policies seem to change almost daily. Is there an expectation that
eventually things will settle down? I think that’s the central challenge for the
industry, that they don’t know where the ultimate outcome is going to fall.
Nobody can really fully answer that question, and what makes it particularly
challenging is that there’ve been so many different rationales given as to why
we’re pursuing one tariff or another that it makes it hard to divine what the
ultimate endgame is going to be. Is it about reducing a trade balance? Is it
about supporting domestic manufacturing? Are there other policy goals that are
trying to be achieved as a result of the tariffs? Not knowing that is what makes
it very difficult for people to operate day to day. In your inbox:Upgrade your

Une décision récente de la cour fédérale a bloqué la possibilité pour le président Trump d'imposer des tarifs sous une loi de pouvoirs d'urgence, ce qui a entraîné un appel de l'administration, ajoutant aux tensions commerciales existantes.

423,DOGE Is Busier Than Ever—and Trump Says Elon Musk Is 'Really Not Leaving',"Elon Musk will not be fully exiting the so-calledDepartment of Government
Efficiency(DOGE)—and its activities are only intensifying. On Friday,President
Donald Trumpthrew cold water on the idea that Musk would fully disappear from
DOGE andthe White Houseforever. ""Elon's really not leaving,” Trump said in a
joint press conference with Musk in the Oval Office. “He's gonna be back and
forth. It's his baby, he's going to be doing a lot of things."" “I expect to
continue to provide advice,"" Musk, wearing a black hat with DOGE written on it
and a black shirt reading “DOGEFATHER,” said during Friday's press conference,
while noting that his legal limit for service as a special government employee
was coming to an end. ""I expect to remain a friend and an advisor.” Federal
workers from at least six agencies tell WIRED thatDOGE-style workis escalating
in their departments. Both new and familiar DOGE faces have also been recently
detailed to new agencies, according to sources. Members of Musk’s early DOGE
team, including Luke Farritor, Gavin Kliger, Edward Coristine, and Sam Corcos,
have met with a number of departments and agencies—including the Treasury, the
Office of Management and Budget, and the FBI—in recent days, seemingly
continuing business as usual, WIRED has learned. The team also appears to be
actively recruiting, according to documents viewed by WIRED. Over the last week,
federal workers have also been asked to urgently review and potentially cancel
contracts across the government. Trump appeared to confirm that contracts were
under review at Friday’s press conference: ""Many contracts, Elon, right now are
being looked at,” he said. Some agencies have also received visits from DOGE at
their headquarters, WIRED has learned. “This doesn’t sound like a group that is
going away, it sounds like one that’s digging in like a parasite,” an IT
specialist at the Department of Agriculture (USDA) tells WIRED. Since DOGE first
began its work in Washington in late January, its representatives have been
eager to cut what they see as superfluous spending in government. In recent
weeks, the pressure to slash and cancel contracts, specifically focused on
workforce management and IT, has drastically increased, multiple sources at a
variety of agencies tell WIRED. “Biggest thing is we are being asked to cut as
many contracts for software and labor as possible,” one tech worker at the
Department of the Interior (DOI) tells WIRED, saying that the stated goal, as
they understand it, has been “to save money and efficiency in consolidated IT.”
“We are cutting developers, telecom, server admins, call center staff etc.,” the
DOI source says. “Some things were bloated and could use the cut. Others are
going to suffer, and our service to the public is going to be degraded.”
Employees at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and all the
agencies under its umbrella, were told that contracts would have to go through a
new approval process called the Departmental Efficiency Review (DER). Any
requisitioning or contract approval is paused until after workers submit a form
to start the DER and the deputy secretary’s office reviews the funding,
according to an email about the process obtained by WIRED. The email also states
that the review will flag any contracts that appear to be expensive and
excessive. Urgent contract oversight is also occurring at the Department of
Labor (DOL). “There is a LOT of pressure to end these contracts as soon as
possible, within the next few days,” a source at the DOL told WIRED on Thursday.
At other agencies, like the USDA and the Treasury, some tech workers were
recently notified that they may be asked to interview with someone at DOGE for
an unspecified reason. “Just last week we were warned of possible contact from
DOGE for interviews,” the USDA IT source says, adding that no one told workers
what the interviews would be about. At Treasury, employees were told those who
perform “some of the more technical functions” would be pulled into these
interviews. Tech contractors at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), one of
the first agencies DOGE burrowed into, were suddenly let go after returning from
the long Memorial Day weekend. Their termination letters credited DOGE with
their dismissal. “The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM), under
the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has modified
the IT services contract with RMCI [an IT contractor] that you support,” the
termination letters say. “As a result, it is with regret that your work on the
OPM contract will end.” During Friday’s press conference, Trump gifted Musk what
appeared to be a golden key in a box that had a picture of the White House,
thanking him for his last few months of government work. “DOGE is integral to
the federal government’s operations, and its mission, as established by the
President’s executive order, will continue under the direction of agency and
department heads in the Trump administration,” White House spokesperson Harrison
Fields tells WIRED. “DOGE has delivered remarkable results at an unprecedented
pace, and its work is far from complete.” United States DOGE Service
administrator Amy Gleason did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
“Elon may be stepping away, but DOGE’s mission remains stronger than ever.
Exposing reckless, wasteful government spending isn’t about one individual—it’s
about a lasting overhaul of Crazy Town,” congressman Aaron Bean, chair of the
House DOGE caucus, tells WIRED about the group’s continued work. “From reducing
fraudulent payments by reforming the Treasury payment system to modernizing
federal processes, like the OPM retirement system, the House DOGE Caucus is
working to codify targeted spending cuts to rein in government overreach and
deliver real accountability to the American people. We are also working closely
with the White House to ensure recession packages reflect DOGE’s critical
findings—turning transparency into action. Rest assured, the House DOGE Caucus
is here for the long haul, and our work is just getting started.” Matt Giles and
Vittoria Elliott contributed reporting. In your inbox:Upgrade your life

L'équipe de Musk chez DOGE semble être active dans l'examen et la révision des contrats gouvernementaux, en particulier ceux liés à la gestion du personnel et aux technologies de l'information, avec pour objectif déclaré de réduire les dépenses jugées superflues. Cette initiative a conduit à la résiliation de certains contrats et au licenciement de nombreux prestataires de services technologiques. 

Cependant, cette approche a suscité des inquiétudes parmi les employés fédéraux qui craignent que ces coupes ne nuisent à la qualité des services publics. La pression pour réduire les coûts est forte et les agences doivent se soumettre à un nouveau processus d'approbation des contrats appelé Departmental Efficiency Review (DER). 

En conclusion, même si Elon Musk se retire progressivement de son rôle opérationnel au sein de DOGE, son influence et la mission du département persistent. Cela soulève une réflexion sur l'équilibre entre la réduction des dépenses gouvernementales et la préservation de la qualité des services public",https://www.wired.com/story/doge-elon-musk-really-not-leaving/,2025-06-02
424,Never Drink Alone: A Guide to Turkish Coffee,"All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.
However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of
products through these links. Out of allcaffeinated rituals, Turkish coffee
takes the (coffee) cake. That’s because, according to some experts, Turkish
coffee isn't a type of coffee—it’s a cooking method. Commonly seen across Middle
Eastern cultures, the beverage looks and acts similar to espresso, served in a
small cup and tasting very rich yet very different. Turkish coffee is made with
coffeeground finerthan espresso (the ideal Turkish coffee grind has a flourlike
consistency) and a brewing process that involves boiling three times. It's an
unfiltered drink, so the coffee grounds eventually settle to the bottom of the
cup. The grounds make for a thick drink, but they also play an important role in
the auspicious ritual of fortune telling, a practice that ultimately inspired my
love for the brew. My introduction to Turkish coffee was with my sister’s
Iranian family (we have different fathers. Her father, Ali, is from Iran). Upon
visiting them to celebrate the Persian New Year, my sister’s aunt made Turkish
coffee after dinner one evening and a family friend proceeded to “read” the
coffee grounds and tell us our fortunes (I dive into the specifics of this
process more below). While I cannot adhere to the validity of fortune telling, I
will say that the family friend predicted I’d have a son. That was over 10 years
ago. At the end of 2024, I gave birth to my first child, a healthy baby boy. But
you don’t have to get your fortune told to enjoy Turkish coffee. You also don’t
have to search too far and wide across the coffee forums to find strong opinions
about the strong coffee and how it should be made. This was possibly my biggest
setback in research, as there are those who suggest beginning the brew with hot
water, while others suggest cold water. Some suggest sugar, others without. Some
suggest high heat, others low. You might have even seen Turkish coffeebeing
prepared in sand. (The owner at my local Palestinian deli tells me that this is
mostly a tourist gimmick.) So, to the coffee nerds, the anal and the meticulous,
if you’re hoping for a “right” way to make Turkish coffee, I hate to disappoint
you. Those who make Turkish coffee in their home regularly measure and brew with
their heart, and each household has a similar but almost always slightly
different method. It’s your preferences that will ultimately guide the ins and
outs of your brewing. Turkish coffee is often served in a cup that's usually no
more than 2 ounces. It might look similar to espresso, but while espresso is
brewed under high pressure, Turkish coffee is brewed by boiling finely ground
(even more fine of a grind than espresso) coffee in acezve. A cezve (referred to
as anibrikin other countries like Palestine) is a small pot with a long handle,
usually holding around 10 to 15 ounces and made out of copper. Demmex Amazon
Generally, Turkish coffee is boiled in the cezve in three parts. After each
boil, a small amount is poured into the coffee cup. The cezve is returned to the
stove after each pour until you’ve filled your cups. The process of boiling the
coffee multiple creates a thick and frothy coffee that is very strong and very
aromatic. Ideally, Turkish coffee is ground with a traditional Turkish coffee
grinderlike this. Because Turkish coffee is ground to a fineness that most
commercialcoffee grinderscannot achieve, your best bet is to buy it pre-ground
(I’ve suggested a few brands below). I almost considered using mySana Grain
Mill(8/10, WIRED Recommends) to see if I could achieve the grind, but didn’t
want to risk the coffee flavor in my homemade flour. Elite Amazon Traditionally,
finely ground Turkish coffee is mixed with water in a cezve, along with some
sugar, depending on your preferences. You’ll bring the coffee to a boil on
low/medium heat over an open flame, usually in three parts. The first boil will
develop a foam (think crema, as seen in other coffee drinks). This foam is
essential to Turkish coffee, as the drink’s frothy thickness makes it stand out
from others. Some recipes suggest using a spoon to scoop the initial foam into
your prepared cups. Otherwise, you’ll use the cezve to pour it into your
prepared coffee cups a little at a time. Put the cezve back on the stove to boil
and repeat this process twice more until you’ve filled your coffee cups to the
rim. Caizen Amazon As I mentioned earlier, it’s important to note that, unlike
other coffee styles in which technicality is prioritized with scales and
thermometers, you’ll see neither of these aspects come into play when making
Turkish coffee. With roots that date back to the 16th century in the Ottoman
Empire, Turkish coffee is a drink integrated into and born of a culture. So,
think of Turkish coffee like your grandma’s cooking—a recipe acts as a guide,
but it is ultimately a process that is led with the heart. You may not place
much stock in auspicious practices, and I don’t blame you. But in case you’re
curious, there are traditions to be respected. The fortune-telling process
begins once you’ve finished your drink. You’ll place your coffee cup upside down
on its saucer. The grounds will drip and scatter, and this is what the fortune
teller will analyze to determine your fortune. Kurukahveci Mehmet Efendi Amazon
Just as my family friend read my coffee grounds on that fateful day 10 years
ago, the practice of fortune telling through Turkish coffee should be done
bysomeone who is experienced in the craft. It is strongly suggested that you do
not try to read your own fortune. This act of fortune telling also establishes
something important when it comes to Turkish coffee: It's a social
activity—something meant to be enjoyed with company. It’s not a science. A great
example of this is my local Palestinian deli using hot water to make its Turkish
coffee. Beginning with hot water may go against what some coffee aficionados
recommend (beginning with cold water is usually ideal for any brewing process to
achieve optimal flavor and extraction), but many places selling Turkish coffee
do this to speed up the process and serve their customers more quickly. When
making the recipe below, don’t focus on being too technical. Demmex Amazon
Yields 2 2-ounce cups of Turkish coffee Combine Turkish coffee, sugar, and water
in your cezve. Stir until combined. Put cezve over a low/medium gas stove flame
and slowly bring to a boil over a couple of minutes (if it boils too fast, it’s
harder to develop the initial foam). Once boiling to the top, quickly take the
cezve off the stove and pour a small amount into your prepared cups (about half
an ounce). Return the cezve to the open flame and bring to a boil. Repeat steps
3 to 4 twice more until you’ve filled your cups to the brim. Serve immediately.

Nast.Ad Choices","L'article explore en profondeur la culture et la méthode de préparation du café turc, un rituel de caféine distinctif et riche en tradition. Contrairement à d'autres types de café, le café turc est reconnu non seulement pour son goût intense mais également comme une méthode de cuisson unique. Le café est moulu très finement, presque comme de la farine, et est cuit par ébullition en trois étapes dans un cezve, une petite casserole en cuivre avec un long manche. Cette méthode produit un café épais et mousseux.

Le café turc est souvent associé à la pratique de la divination par la lecture des marcs de café, un aspect culturel qui renforce son rôle dans les interactions sociales plutôt que comme simple boisson. Selon les traditions, après avoir bu le café, la tasse est retournée pour que les marcs de café puissent être interprétés par un diseur de bonne aventure expérimenté.

L'article souligne également les diverses opinions sur la préparation du café turc, y compris les débats sur l'utilisation de l'eau chaude ou froide, et avec ou sans sucre. Ces variations montrent que, comme dans la cuisine de grand-mère, la préparation du café turc est guidée par le cœur et les préférences personnelles plutôt que par des mesures strictes.

En conclusion, le café turc est plus qu'une boisson; c'est une expérience culturelle et sociale qui se transmet de génération en génération. Cette tradition offre une fenêtre sur l'importance des rituels culinaires dans le renforcement des liens communautaires et familiaux, invitant à une réflexion sur comment d'autres cultures intègrent des pratiques similaires dans leur quotidien.",https://www.wired.com/story/a-guide-to-turkish-coffee/,2025-06-02
425,We Bought a ‘Peeing’ Robot Attack Dog From Temu. It Was Even Weirder Than Expected,"All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.
However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of
products through these links. In my 15years of reviewing tech, this pellet-
firing, story-telling, pretend-urinating robot attack dog is easily the
strangest thing I’ve ever tested. Arriving in a slightly battered box following
a series of questionable decisions onTemu, I’m immediately drawn to the words
“FIRE BULLETS PET” emblazoned on the box. And there, resting behind the
protective plastic window with all the innocence of a newborn lamb, lies the
plastic destroyer of worlds that my four-and-a-half-year-old immediately (and
inexplicably), names Clippy. Clippy is a robot dog. Of sorts. And he (my son
assures me that it’s a he), is clearly influenced by the remarkable, and
somewhat terrifying, robotic canine creations ofBoston Dynamics—a renowned
company that’sleading the robot revolution. Naturally, given the $50 price tag
(a little less if you don't want the—ahem—spinal-mounted pellet gun), I’m not
expecting Clippy to perform miracles. But, given mytrack record, being served an
Instagram ad promising all manner of animatronic wizardry for less than the cost
of a round of drinks in a London bar, the opportunity was too tempting to pass
up. What happened, almost inevitably, was a lesson in not taking the social
media ads you are served at face value. But, actually? It was also a lot of
ridiculous fun. After freeing Clippy from his box, I’m immediately met with some
of the lightest, cheapest, glossiest plastic I’ve ever come across. I have
nothing against plastic. Remember theNokia Lumia 920? Its polycarbonate body
remains one of my favourite phone designs to this day. Sturdy, solid, and light,
it was everything an object clad in plastic should be. Clippy and his
accompanying remote, on the other hand, provide a somewhat Christmas cracker
toy-like level of confidence in their durability. Clippy’s main body, filled
with the bulk of the electronics, is weighty enough, but his four spindly legs
do not give the impression that they’re up to the task of supporting anything.
Except, of course, that I am in ownership of the turret-toting model, which
promises to lay waste to enemies by bombarding them with water-absorbent pellets
(more on that in a bit). Overall, the entire ensemble resembles an elongated
CCTV camera on legs, with a turret resting on top—suitably menacing, and
genuinely not far off Boston Dynamic’s bona fide offering, in looks, at least.
Courtesy of Esat Dedezade Elsewhere, I can only assume that the controller has
been pumped full of helium, such is its hollow, airy lightness. Heavily inspired
by the shape of an Xbox controller, I particularly love the fact that its bumper
buttons and triggers are simply formed from one immobile piece of moulded
plastic. There’s something quite beautiful in their utter uselessness that I
enjoy very much. As for the business end, it's an ADHD nightmare. Littered with
a chaotic array of buttons in seemingly no logical order, I give credit to the
designers for creating a controller that laughs in the face of muscle memory.
Initial attempts at turning Clippy on are unsuccessful. The on/off switch does
nothing, and the charging light remains dead when the USB-C cable is plugged in.
There are no instructions. Opening the battery compartment reveals the
culprit—the battery is disconnected. Was this to avoid it draining in transit,
or to reduce the risk of spontaneous combustion? Either way, it’s plugged back
in. Clippy lives. And wow, he’s loud. The built-in speakers are beyond shrill. I
desperately look through the carnage of controller buttons, hoping to find a
volume or mute option. There isn’t one. Naturally, I press “urinate” first.
Clippy’s hind leg raises. That, I expected. What I didn’t expect, was cheerful
whistling, and the sound of water tinkling into a toilet bowl. I look, and
happen upon the “handstand” button. This, I feel, will be an impressive test of
his dexterity. A handstand maneuver will surely call upon multiple gyroscopes
and accelerometers, combining and crunching data from numerous sensors in real
time to ensure that Clippy’s body remains perfectly poised in balance. I press
the button, and Clippy immediately—and rather violently—faceplants. The force of
this manoeuvre takes me off guard, and the impact is loud. I am worried. A
moment passes, his rear legs rise, and they begin to twitch. I presume this
apparent seizure is meant to represent elegant scissor kicks. It’s reminiscent
of how ants communicate with their antennae, a form of silent communication.
“Don’t blame me bro, did you really expect anything else?” I can almost hear him
plead. But, somehow, Clippy does return to his feet and appears unscathed, ready
for more. Me? I'm not so sure. As I mentioned, the controller has many, many
buttons—no less than 17 functions in fact—and I’m not going to bore you with
overly gratuitous descriptions for each one. Instead, here’s a quick rundown of
the main buttons, to give you a general idea of some of Clippy's talents: Kung
fu:Absolutely zero semblance of any martial art moves, or even a cheeky
backflip. Instead (and completely inexplicably), some form of poolside, Lost
Frequencies-esque lounge music blasts out. Clippy “dances.” Swimming/Dance:I
recently saw Usher perform live. Both of these buttons involve vigorous floor-
humping that surpass even his most sexually charged efforts. A truly impressive
feat. Oh, and a side note for any optimists out there, Clippy is not waterproof.
Do not, I repeat do not, introduce him to water. Push-up:Clippy blasts out push-
ups while playing the guitar riff from“Eye of the Tiger.” I have no further
notes. Story:Buckle up, pressing this button results in very loud, tinny
classical music blaring out over a spoken story. The narrator has an Eric
Cartman-like twang to their voice, and the speaker quality means I can barely
make out what’s being said. The only plot I manage to grasp is about an old
woman and an ageing cat. The woman scolds the cat for not being able to catch
mice, as it has no teeth. The cat bestows a moral about respecting our elders
for the contributions they used to make in their youth. The next story, I think,
involves a pigeon. It may be injured. Courtesy of Esat Dedezade Despite this
clearly incredible skillset, it is interesting that Clippy's ability to be
controlled or steered via the remote is … flawed. Going forward is generally
fine, and there are left and right buttons which cause him to turn very slowly,
often toppling over in the process. There is no reverse, so I constantly have to
pick him up before he collides with walls and furniture (no collision detection
cameras appear to be present). He can, at least, shake hands (or ""hadn-shake"" on
the remote) like any well-trained pup. It would also be remiss not to mention
that there is an official app which lets you control your robot dog via
Bluetooth. Once you figure out how to change the language to English, it’s easy
enough to navigate, and there are even some bonus features they couldn't squeeze
onto the remote. For example, you can select different “foods” for him to eat,
ranging from a bone to “Nuclear Energy Source”—all of which result in various
forms of eating animations. There’s also a voice command mode, which doesn’t
seem to work. Despite offering all the permissions asked for (including, against
my better judgement, access to my phone and files), voice commands seem to fall
on deaf ears. There’s also a program mode which lets you set up custom actions,
though all my attempts seem to end up in more faceplants. According to the
product page, Clippy’s back-mounted turret “can be loaded with water bombs to
launch for fun.” The image accompanying this description is impressive. Two blue
projectiles appear to blast forth from the cannon. I immediately picture an
autonomous robotic guard dog patrolling the house, scanning for threats, and
dispensing justice as appropriate. The reality is a tiny packet of minuscule
blue balls, about a millimetre in diameter. Once soaked in water for a few
hours, they plump up, and you can load them into the turret, before firing away.
The test takes place in the makeshift bathtub firing range. I drop a few of the
blue gel-like pellets into what is presumably the correct slot in the turret (I
once again remind you of the lack of any instructions), and tell my son to stand
back, in case the velocity rebounds anything towards our eyes. I look down at
the controller, and finally press the “attack” button. Clippy walks forward a
few steps, crouches to steady his aim, and two pellets dribble out with all the
urgency of a clogged ketchup bottle. This method is repeated about ten times,
with mixed results. At best, a pellet is fired relatively straight, but still
not without any meaningful force—certainly not enough to even penetrate a wet
square of toilet paper. We tried. After the ammo is spent, we decide that it’s
time to watch him faceplant again. But should you buy this thing, as
(relatively) cheap as it is? I think the answer is obvious. But while it’s all
too easy to slate, playing around with Clippy has taken me back to my childhood,
where toys like this were life. Clippy, as terrible as he is, has entertained my
son daily, for the week that we've spent testing him. He brought him into our
bedroom every morning, waking me up with a shrill, unintelligible story before
blasting out a guitar riff with an enthusiasm that is already wearing thin. It
won’t be long, of course, before Clippy gathers dust in some corner, replaced by
the Next Thing. I imagine he’ll end up in a thrift store, awaiting a new family
to dazzle and confuse in equal measure. I just hope, whoever they are, that they
like Survivor. In your inbox:Upgrade your life withWIRED-tested gear “Wi-Fi

Clippy, qui est vendu pour environ 50 $, est décrit comme un robot qui tire des granulés, raconte des histoires et prétend uriner. Bien que le produit promette une gamme de capacités animatroniques à un prix abordable, l'auteur découvre rapidement que Clippy est principalement composé de plastique bon marché et possède des caractéristiques ludiques mais globalement inutiles. Les tentatives pour contrôler le robot via une télécommande ou une application sont entravées par des défauts de conception et une performance médiocre.

Malgré ses nombreux défauts, Clippy procure un divertissement significatif, en particulier au fils de l'auteur, évoquant ainsi une nostalgie pour les jouets simples de l'enfance. L'article se termine sur une note réfléchissante, suggérant que, bien que Clippy ne soit pas un produit de haute technologie et puisse finalement être oublié, il offre un plaisir temporaire et rappelle l'importance des jouets dans le développement et l'amusement des enfants.

Cet article soulève des questions sur l'impact de la publicité sur les réseaux sociaux sur les comportements d'achat des consommateurs et l'importance de gérer les attentes face aux produits technologiques bon marché.
