         "How to Make AI Faster and Smarter—With a Little Help from Physics",
         "The original versionofthis storyappeared inQuanta Magazine. When she was 10\nyears old,Rose Yugot a birthday present that would change her life—and,\npotentially, the way we study physics. Her uncle got her a computer. That was a\nrare commodity in China 25 years ago, and the gift did not go unused. At first,\nYu mainly played computer games, but in middle school she won an award for web\ndesign. It was the first of many computer-related honors. Yu went on to major in\ncomputer science at Zhejiang University, where she won a prize for innovative\nresearch. For her graduate studies, she chose the University of Southern\nCalifornia (USC), partly because the same uncle—who was the only person she knew\nin the United States—was then working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in nearby\nPasadena. Yu earned her doctorate in 2017 with an award for best dissertation.\nHer most recent honor came in January, when President Joe Biden, in his last\nweek in office, gave her a Presidential Early Career Award. Yu, now an associate\nprofessor at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), is a leader in a\nfield known as “physics-guided deep learning,” having spent years incorporating\nour knowledge of physics into artificial neural networks. The work has not only\nintroduced novel techniques for building and training these systems, but it’s\nalso allowed her to make progress on several real-world applications. She has\ndrawn on principles of fluid dynamics to improve traffic predictions, sped up\nsimulations of turbulence to enhance our understanding of hurricanes, and\ndevised tools that helped predict the spread of Covid-19. This work has brought\nYu closer to her grand dream—deploying a suite of digital lab assistants that\nshe calls AI Scientist. She now envisions what she calls a “partnership” between\nhuman researchers and AI tools, fully based on the tenets of physics and thus\ncapable of yielding new scientific insights. Combining inputs from a team of\nsuch assistants, in her opinion, may be the best way to boost the discovery\nprocess. Quanta spoke with Yu about turbulence in its many guises, how to get\nmore out of AI, and how it might get us out of urban gridlock. The interview has\nbeen condensed and edited for clarity. Yu on the UCSD campus, where she is an\nassociate professor. When did you first try to combine physics with deep\nlearning? Rose Yu:It started with traffic. I was a grad student at USC, and the\ncampus is right near the intersection of I-10 and I-110. To get anywhere, you\nhave to go through a lot of traffic, which can be very annoying. In 2016, I\nbegan to wonder whether I could do anything about this. Deep learning—which uses\nmultilayered neural networks to elicit patterns from data—was getting really hot\nback then. There was already a lot of excitement about applications in image\nclassification, but images are just static things. I wondered whether deep\nlearning could help with problems where things are constantly changing. I wasn’t\nthe first person to consider this, but my colleagues and I did find a novel way\nof framing the problem. What was your new approach? First, we thought of traffic\nin terms of the physical process of diffusion. In our model, the flow of traffic\nover a network of roads is analogous to the flow of fluids over a\nsurface—motions that are governed by the laws of fluid dynamics. But our main\ninnovation was to think of traffic as a graph, from the mathematical field of\ngraph theory. Sensors, which monitor traffic on highways and other roads, serve\nas the nodes of this graph. And the edges of the graph represent the roads (and\ndistances) between those sensors. Yu’s interest in computers began with a gift\nfor her 10th birthday. A graph provides a snapshot of the entire road network at\na given time, telling you the average velocity of cars at every point on the\ngraph. When you put together a series of these snapshots, spaced every five\nminutes apart, you get a good picture of how traffic is evolving. From there,\nyou can try to predict what will happen in the future. The big challenge in deep\nlearning is that you need a lot of data to train the neural network.\nFortunately, one of my advisers, Cyrus Shahabi, had worked for many years on the\nproblem of traffic forecasting, and he’d accumulated a vast amount of LA traffic\ndata that I had access to. So how good were your predictions? Prior to our work,\npeople could only make traffic forecasts that were reliable for about 15\nminutes. Our forecasts were valid for one hour—a big improvement. Our code was\ndeployed by Google Maps in 2018. A bit later, Google invited me to become a\nvisiting researcher. That’s about when you began working on climate modeling,\nright? Yes, that started in 2018, when I gave a talk at the Lawrence Berkeley\nNational Laboratory. Afterward, I spoke with scientists there, and we looked for\na problem that would be a good testbed for physics-guided deep learning. We\nsettled on predicting the evolution of turbulent flow, which is a key factor in\nclimate models, as well as an area of major uncertainty. Familiar examples of\nturbulence are the swirling patterns you see after pouring milk into a cup of\ncoffee and giving it a stir. In the oceans, swirls like this can span thousands\nof miles. Predictions of turbulent behavior that are based on solving the\nNavier-Stokes equation, which describes the flow of fluids, are considered the\ngold standard in this field. But the required calculations are very slow, which\nis why we don’t have good models for predicting hurricanes and tropical\ncyclones. The heavy congestion of Los Angeles first inspired Yu to model highway\ntraffic as the flow of fluids. And deep learning can help? The basic idea is\nthat deep neural networks that are trained on our best numerical simulations can\nlearn to imitate—or as we say, “emulate”—those simulations. They do that by\nrecognizing properties and patterns buried within the data. They don’t have to\ngo through time-consuming, brute-force calculations to find approximate\nsolutions. Our models sped up predictions by a factor of 20 in two-dimensional\nsettings and by a factor of 1,000 in three-dimensional settings. Something like\nour turbulence prediction module might someday be inserted into bigger climate\nmodels that can do better at predicting things like hurricanes. Where else does\nturbulence show up? It’s pretty much everywhere. Turbulence in blood flow, for\ninstance, can lead to strokes or heart attacks. And when I was a postdoc at\nCaltech, I coauthored a paper that looked into stabilizing drones. Propellor-\ngenerated airflows interact with the ground to create turbulence. That, in turn,\ncan cause the drone to wobble. We used a neural network to model the turbulence,\nand that led to better control of drones during takeoffs and landings. I’m\ncurrently working with scientists at UCSD and General Atomics on fusion power.\nOne of the keys to success is learning how to control the plasma, which is a\nhot, ionized phase of matter. At temperatures of about 100 million degrees,\ndifferent kinds of turbulence arise within the plasma, and physics-based\nnumerical models that characterize that behavior are very slow. We’re developing\na deep learning model that should be able to predict the plasma’s behavior in a\nsplit second, but this is still a work in progress. Yu and doctoral student\nJianke Yang in her office at UCSD. Where did your AI Scientist idea come from?\nIn the past couple of years, my group has developed AI algorithms that can\nautomatically discover symmetry principles from data. For example, our algorithm\nidentified the Lorentz symmetry, which has to do with the constancy of the speed\nof light. Our algorithm also identified rotational symmetry—the fact, for\nexample, that a sphere doesn’t look any different regardless of how you rotate\nit—which is something it was not specifically trained to know about. While these\nare well-known properties, our tools also have the capability to discover new\nsymmetries presently unknown to physics, which would constitute a huge\nbreakthrough. It then occurred to me that if our tools can discover symmetries\nfrom raw data, why don’t we try to generalize this? These tools could also\ngenerate research ideas or new hypotheses in science. That was the genesis of AI\nScientist. What exactly is AI Scientist—just a fancy kind of neural net? It’s\nnot a single neural network, but rather an ensemble of computer programs that\ncan help scientists make new discoveries. My group has already developed\nalgorithms that can help with individual tasks, such as weather forecasting,\nidentifying the drivers of global temperature rise, or trying to discover causal\nrelationships like the effects of vaccination policies on disease transmission.\nWe’re now building a broader “foundation” model that’s versatile enough to\nhandle multiple tasks. Scientists gather data from all types of instruments, and\nwe want our model to include a variety of data types—numbers, text, images, and\nvideos. We have an early prototype, but we want to make our model more\ncomprehensive, more intelligent and better trained before we release it. That\ncould happen within a couple of years. What do you imagine it could do? AI can\nassist in practically every step of the scientific discovery process. When I say\n“AI Scientist,” I really mean an AI scientific assistant. The literature survey\nstage in an experiment, for example, typically requires a massive data-gathering\nand organization effort. But now, a large language model can read and summarize\nthousands of books during a single lunch break. What AI is not good at is\njudging scientific validity. In this case, it can’t compete with an experienced\nresearcher. While AI could help with hypothesis generation, the design of\nexperiments and data analysis, it still cannot carry out sophisticated\nexperiments. How far would you like to see the concept go? As I picture it, an\nAI Scientist could relieve researchers of some of the drudgery while letting\npeople handle the creative aspects of science. That’s something we’re\nparticularly good at. Rest assured, the goal is not to replace human scientists.\nI don’t envision—nor would I ever want to see—a machine substituting for, or\ninterfering with, human creativity.

         "Republican Operatives Want to Distance Themselves From Elon Musk's DOGE",
         "For weeks, WhiteHouse officials and Republican operatives weren’t quite sure\nwhen, or if,Elon Muskwould actually beleavingthe government. Now, many\nRepublicans are already looking to distance themselves from Musk’s team\nentirely. “Everybody is in a bit of a fucking pinch,” a Republican with\nknowledge of the situation tells WIRED. “You know, the whole thing’s just\nfucking ridiculous, honestly. People agree with what he’s trying to do. But some\npeople just need a villain.” WIRED spoke to a number of close advisers and\noperatives in Trumpworld, who were granted anonymity because of the sensitive\nnature of the topic. While Musk’s step-back seems to be imminent, those inside\nand around the White House are unsure of what all of this means for the future\nof his so-calledDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE). Still, none of the\nRepublicans interviewed for this story believe DOGE is going anywhere anytime\nsoon. “DOGE is popular,” says a source close to the White House. “Even if Elon,\npersonally, is less so.” (Pollsshowthat DOGE is not popular with the public.)\nThe White House did not reply to requests for comment. Today, Trump willhold a\ndual press conferencewith Musk in what appears to be an attempt at a final send-\noff. “This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be\nwith us, helping all the way,” Trump posted on Truth Social, announcing the\nevent. “Elon is terrific!” While Musk’s supposed departure has been making\nheadlines, to those attuned to DOGE’s actual workings, the most seismic move\ncame on Thursday, when news broke that top Musk lieutenantSteve Daviswould also\nbe leaving DOGE. Davis has worked with Musk for years, including at X and as the\npresident of the Boring Company. He has been vital to day-to-day DOGE\noperations, andSahil Lavingia, a recently fired DOGE staffer,told WIRED that\nDavis led the group. “Steven was the only person who was across everything,”\nLavingia says. Not everyone in Trumpworld, though, was aware of his role. “I\ndon’t know who Steve Davis is,” a well-placed source close to the White House\ntells WIRED, claiming that other Trump advisers and White House aides are\nequally in the dark about one of the most important operators in the government\ntakeover. White House sources do say, however, that they are looking forward to\nthe departure of Katie Miller, the wife of White House deputy chief of staff for\npolicy Stephen Miller, whom CNNreportswill be working for Musk, with one source\ntelling the outlet she is now with Musk “full-time.” She’s been one of Musk’s\nkey allies since his arrival in Washington, and,as WIRED reportedin February,\nhas been the one tasked with delivering him bad news. Both Millers have been\ncredited with showing Musk around Washington and accompanying him toevents.\n“There’s a lot of people in the business that work with her, or have worked with\nher, and she leaves bodies everywhere she’s been,” a senior Republican\nstrategist with knowledge of the situation tells WIRED. Katie Miller did not\nreply to requests for comment. Republicans also said there was a palpable sense\nof relief about the prospect of DOGE getting out of the headlines even before\nMusk anddifferent members of his leadership teamappeared to begin their\ndepartures. A Republican donor organizer and campaign adviser tells WIRED that\nthey’re unconvinced Musk won’t come back. (“Nothing is cast in stone with Trump\nand his people,” they say.) Nonetheless, they say, they’re telling clients\nrunning for office—both new candidates and incumbents—to use Musk’s exit as a\nchance to distance themselves from the DOGE chain saw. “I think people need to\ndistance themselves from it,” they say.

         "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.\nHowever, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of\nproducts through these links. Confused by Apple’snaming conventions? You’re not\nthe only one.Bloombergreportsthat this year atWWDC, Apple plans to announce a\nbroad overhaul of all of its operating systems. That includes renaming them to\nbe more consistent. Starting this year, Apple will reportedly begin denoting\neach OS version for each product by year, instead of by version. Confusingly, it\nwill start with thenextyear, rather than this year (just like cars). So the\nversions we'll see at this year’s WWDC will not be iOS 25, but rather iOS 26,\nwatchOS 26, and so on, in place of iOS 19 and watchOS 12. All the top gear news\nof the week inone place. Here's more you may have missed this week: The move is\nreportedly part of a larger push toward a cohesive user experience across\nplatforms. The overhaul could encompass everything from updated icons, apps,\nbuttons, and a fresh design language, and it’s expected to be universal across\nall the operating systems. Apple’s fundamentally simple and irresistible user\ninterface is a core part of the company’s DNA, so it will be interesting to see\nhow customers react to a big redesign (hopefully better than the Apple Photos\nredesign). We’ll find out at WWDC, whichkicks offon June 9 at 1 pm ET.—Adrienne\nSo After a light smattering of features when it launchedthe OnePlus 13 in\nJanuary, OnePlus is now ready to go all in on AI for its phones. Its approach is\nquite similar to what Nothing introduced a few months ago on theNothing Phone\n(3a) series: a dedicated AI button on the side of the phone, though this one\nreplaces the original OnePlus Alert Slider. Dubbed the Plus Key, you can\ncustomize it to trigger specific apps or shortcuts on the phone, with an\ninterface that looks almost exactly like Apple's Action Button. By default, it\nlaunches AI Plus Mind, a system that will save whatever's on the screen so you\ncan recall it later. The idea is that you'll press it when you see an ad for a\nconcert while browsing, or an event invite—pressing the Plus Key will save the\nrelevant info in the companion app, and the app will extract helpful info to\ncreate a calendar event on your behalf. The Plus Key and AI Plus Mind will debut\nfirst on the OnePlus 13s, a phone launching in select markets this June; it's\nnot coming to the US. Later this year, the AI features will roll out to the\nOnePlus 13 series, with other devices to follow. OnePlus says it's actively\nworking on more features like AI VoiceScribe, to record, summarize, and\ntranslate calls and meetings; AI Translation, to consolidate all translation\ncapabilities into one app; and AI Reframe, to adjust the composition of your\nshots with generative AI. Samsung is rumored to announce its next generation\noffolding phonessometime this summer—the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7—and the\ncompany officially confirmed this in ablog postannouncing the rollout of the One\nUI 8 beta program. One UI is the name of Samsung's Android layer, and version\neight is based on the upcoming version ofAndroid 16. While the beta program will\nbe available for existing devices, Samsung says One UI 8 will “debut on\nSamsung's newest foldables this summer,” making them the first to run Android\n16. That's a break from the norm, as Google historically made its Pixel devices\nthe first to run the latest version of Android. This is likely because Google\nmoved up the Android 16 window; instead of arriving in October, it's coming\nmidsummer. Google celebrated the 10th anniversary of Google Photos on May 28,\nand it has dished out a few new features to mark the occasion, including making\na fewPixel 9-exclusive capabilities—like the Reimagine and Auto Frame AI\nfeatures—more broadly available. A redesigned editor now also shows more editing\ntools at a glance, and you can also select parts of the image to access specific\ntools instead of hunting for them in menus. For example, tap the background of\nan image to pull up the portrait blur tool so you can adjust the strength of the\nbackground blur effect. A new “AI Enhance” button will also merge several of\nGoogle's AI capabilities, like Magic Eraser, with other standard editing tools\nfor a faster edit. The new redesigned editing layout will roll out to Android\ndevices in June, with iOS getting the update later this year. Also new is the\ncapability to generate a QR code to share albums with people around you (or\nprint it out for group events). You can let folks who scan the code add their\nown images to the album, too. Ricoh has announced the GR IV pocket camera, the\nsuccessor to theGR III, one of thebest pocket camerasI've ever tested. The GR IV\nhas a new lens with seven elements, but it remains the same focal length: 18.3mm\nf/2.8 (roughly 28mm in 35mm equivalent). So far, no word on whether there will\nbe a GR IVx to replace the 40mm lens model. The GR IV has an updated APS-C\nsensor that bumps the resolution slightly from 24 megapixels to 26. The neutral\ndensity filter remains, and while the outside appears to have been redesigned,\nwith slightly different buttons, the basic silhouette is the same. Like the GR\nIII, there is no flash. A built-in flash would be nice (the GR II had one), but\nthe ISO range of the GR IV is better, reaching 204,800 ISO at the top end, which\nshould help with low-light photography. There's also five-axis stabilization (up\nfrom the three-axis of the GR III). Perhaps the most interesting news for fans\nof the GR camera series is that there will be face and eye detection autofocus\ntracking, which would seem to mean autofocus has been improved. If the GR III\nhas a weakness, it's autofocus. There will also be 53 gigabytes of built-in\nstorage (usable), which is perfect for a camera like this, though my enthusiasm\nfor that is tempered by the fact that the GR IV will use microSD cards rather\nthan full-size SD. The GR IV is set to arrive this fall, with another model\nfeaturing a Highlight Diffusion Filter coming \"after winter 2025.\"\nInterestingly, Ricoh says production and shipment of the Ricoh GR III will stop\nin July 2025, due to difficulty in procuring parts and components. The 40mm\nGRIIIx will continue to be sold for now. —Scott Gilbertson In your inbox:Upgrade\nyour life withWIRED-tested gear “Wi-Fi keeps going down”: Trump’s RTO mandate is\ngoing terribly Big Story:The worm thatno computer scientist can crack Yuval Noah\nHarari: “Prepare to share the planet with AI superintelligence” Uncanny\nValley:An insider look atthe influence of Silicon Valley 10% Off Wayfair Promo\nCode with sign-up 20% off Dyson Promo Code $50 Off In-Person Tax Prep When You\nSwitch From Your Tax Current Provider Up to $500 off cameras at Canon Save extra\n10% Off TurboTax Exclusive: Up To 50% Off 6 Boxes With Factor Promo Code More\nFrom WIRED Reviews and Guides ©2025Condé Nast.

         "Your Gmail Inbox Is Running Slow. Do These Things to Fix It",
         "For more than1.8 billion peoplein the world, there is one service that rules\nthem all:Gmail. A primary conduit for communication, the email service\nthatGoogle launched in 2004is now as prevalent as the iPhone, a Windows laptop,\nand the deep blue sky. I created my first Gmail account way back in 2005, and my\ncurrent account has existed since 2012. My life revolves around email, but\nsometimes those revolutions can run a bit slow. Hampered by too many emails, I\nfind myself clicking and waiting for an email to open and waiting again to see\nthe attached files. I knew I had to solve the problem. Google doesn’t provide a\nlot of guidance for speeding up one’s Gmail inbox, likely because the company\ndoesn’t want to admit it runs slow at times. I decided to “learn by doing” and\ndiscovered several tips and tricks that helped speed up the service. My Gmail is\nseverely cluttered and choking on too many emails and hundreds of labels. I\nneeded to do major surgery. I started by disabling a few extensions and add-ons\nfor Gmail, and then deleting a bunch of recent emails, but those actions made a\nnegligible impact. My theory—which I asked Google about, and which the company\ndid not directly answer—is that Gmail has to spend extra time loading emails and\nrunning searches when it has to keep track of years and years worth of very\nlarge files. I never delete any emails, mostly because I can search for old tax\nforms, dig up contracts and even find old photos. It’s getting ridiculous,\nthough: I have 652,000 emails that use 162 gigabytes of storage. It was time to\ndo something about it. To find emails with the largest attachments, use Gmail’s\nbuilt-in search operators. In Gmail’s search box, start by typing “in:anywhere\nlarger:40M” and review the results. This will surface emails in any of your\nsubfolders with attachments totalling more than 40 megabytes. In my case, I only\nfound three emails with a massive attachment, so I tried “in:anywhere\nlarger:25M” and then got nine emails with excessively large files. It was easy\nto glance through them and determine if they were worth keeping. (If you’re\nfeeling adventurous, you can also use the newGemini AI for Gmail botto search\nfor emails with large attachments.) Once you hit delete, make sure you empty the\ntrash as well, otherwise those emails—and their large files—will stick around.\nOn the left side, clickTrash, thenMore, thenEmpty trash now. One of Gmail’s\nstandout features is the ability to apply labels to emails to help you sort the\ncontents of a busy inbox. But labels are just one more thing for Gmail to keep\ntrack of, and old labels that don’t matter to you anymore are just clogging the\npipes. There’s no easy way to bulk delete labels, so you have to manually remove\nthem. To do that, clickManage Labelsin Gmail’s left-hand menu bar. Scroll down\nto your list of labels, then selectRemove labelfor all your unused labels. I\nremoved 350 labels! The emails are still there, but I’ve shed the weight of\nthose obsolete sorting systems I no longer need. I also deleted very old emails.\nTo find your oldest emails, clickAll mailon the left, then on the upper right\nclick the displayed pages to see Oldest instead of Newest. Select all emails on\nthe screen and delete them as needed, clicking through each page of emails to\nsee more. You can also use the “older_than” search operator; type\n“older_than:1y” in the search bar to see all emails more than one year old. Try\n“older_than:2y” and so on. (The Gemini bot might also be able to help find older\nemails here; give it a shot if you prefer chat-style searching.) For me, after\ndeleting large files and labels, and deleting thousands of old emails, Gmail ran\nnoticeably faster. One other fix has to do with how many files you view in your\ninbox. It’s a basic rule of computing, especially in web-based apps: showing\nless information on the screen means the app doesn’t need to work as hard. Go\ntoSettings, thenSee all settings. Look for the pop-up next toMaximum page\nsizeand select a lower number, say 25. I found this setting did help even in an\nolder, clunky Gmail account from years ago. I wanted to do more, and I was\ntempted to clear my browser cache, which is a catch-all solution for speeding up\nweb performance. For every site you visit, files and settings are stored\nlocally, and as those things build up over time, they can slow down your\nbrowser. There’s a downside to clearing the cache, though: you’ll lose all your\nsaved sessions and you’ll have to log back into all your websites, not just\nGmail. Instead, it’s better to clear the cache just for Gmail. This might sound\nonerous, but it\u0000’s easier than it sounds: To clear the cache for one site, first\ngo to that site (in our case, Gmail.com). Then, in Chrome, pressF12(or go\ntoView>Developer>Developer tools) to bring up the developer tools. Click on\ntheApplicationtab at the top, and clickClear site data. This really sped things\nup for me, even more than deleting large files and labels. I was cooking with\ngas, but felt like things could still be faster. This is a more dramatic\nsolution, but it’s amazing how well it works. A few years ago, I switched Gmail\naddresses because my old account was too clogged. I started over with a new\nGmail inbox that was sprightly and trim. It felt like buying a brand new car. Of\ncourse, the downside is that you have to let everyone know about your new email\naddress. That’s easier than you think. After creating the new Gmail address, go\nback to your old one. In Gmail, go toSettingsand clickSee all settings, then\nscroll down to theVacation responder. You’re taking a permanent vacation from\nyour clogged email, so set the date range to run all year long. Type a message\nabout how you’re changing emails, and include the new email address. You can\nalso forward all incoming messages to the new inbox. Click theForwarding and\nPOP/IMAPtab at the top, and type in a new forwarding email. Gmail might prompt\nyou for verification from another device to confirm it’s really you. Then,\nclickProceed. Gmail will also send a confirmation email from the new email\naddress to your old one. In your old account, click that confirmation link.\nYou’re all set! Everyone will be notified when they email your old account, and\nyou’ll receive incoming emails in your new account. Whether you follow these\ntips to liven up an older Gmail account or start over with a new one, the good\nnews is that you’ll notice a speed-up either way. Even my old Gmail account is\nnow faster than ever.

         "A Hacker May Have Deepfaked Trump’s Chief of Staff in a Phishing Campaign",
         "For years, amysterious figure who goes by the handle Stern led the Trickbot\nransomware gang and evaded identification—even as other members of the group\nwere outed in leaks andunmasked. This weekGerman authorities revealed, without\nmuch fanfare, who they believe that enigmatic hacker kingpin to be: Vi­ta­ly\nNi­ko­lae­vich Kovalev, a 36-year-old Russian man who remains at large in his\nhome country. Closer to home,WIRED revealedthat Customs and Border Protection\nhas mouth-swabbed 133,000 migrant children and teenagers to collect their DNA\nand uploaded their genetic data into a national criminal database used by local,\nstate, and federal law enforcement. As the Trump administration’s migrant\ncrackdown continues, often justified through invocations of crime and terrorism,\nWIRED alsouncovered evidencethat ties a Swedish far-right mixed-martial-arts\ntournament to an American neo-Nazi “fight club” based in California. For those\nseeking to evade the US government surveillance,we offered tipsabout more\nprivate alternatives to US-based web browsing, email, and search tools. And we\nassembled a more generalguide to protecting yourself from surveillance and\nhacking, based on questions our senior writer Matt Burgess received in a Reddit\nAsk Me Anything. But that's not all. Each week, we round up the security and\nprivacy news we didn't cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the\nfull stories. And stay safe out there. The FBI is investigating who impersonated\nSusie Wiles, the Trump White House’s chief of staff and one of the president’s\nclosest advisers, in a series of fraudulent messages and calls to high-profile\nRepublican political figures and business executives, The Wall Street Journal\nreported. Government officials and authorities involved in the probe say the\nspear-phishing messages and calls appear to have targeted individuals on Wiles’\ncontact list, and Wiles has reportedly told colleagues that her personal phone\nwas hacked to gain access to those contacts. Despite Wiles’ reported claim of\nhaving her device hacked, it remains unconfirmed whether this was actually how\nattackers identified Wiles’ associates. It would also be possible to assemble\nsuch a target list from a combination of publicly available information and data\nsold by gray-market brokers. “It's an embarrassing level of security awareness.\nYou cannot convince me they actually did their security trainings,” says Jake\nWilliams, a former NSA hacker and vice president of research and development at\nHunter Strategy. “This is the type of garden-variety social engineering that\neveryone can end up dealing with these days, and certainly top government\nofficials should be expecting it.” In some cases, the targets received not just\ntext messages but phone calls that impersonated Wiles’ voice, and some\ngovernment officials believe the calls may have used artificial intelligence\ntools to fake Wiles’ voice. If so, that would make the incident one of the most\nsignificant cases yet of so-called deepfake software being used in a phishing\nattempt. It’s not yet clear how Wiles’ phone might have been hacked, but the FBI\nhas ruled out involvement by a foreign nation in the impersonation campaign, the\nbureau reportedly told White House officials. In fact, while some of the\nimpersonation attempts appeared to have political goals—a member of Congress,\nfor instance, was asked to assemble a list of people Trump might pardon—in at\nleast one other case the impersonator tried to trick a target into setting up a\ncash transfer. That attempt at a money grab suggests that the spoofing campaign\nmay be less of an espionage operation than a run-of-the-mill cybercriminal fraud\nscheme, albeit one with a very high-level target. “There’s an argument here for\nusing something like Signal—yes, the irony—or another messaging platform that\noffers an independent form of authentication if users want to validate who\nthey’re talking to,” Hunter Strategy's Williams says. “The key thing as always\nis for government officials to be using vetted tools and following all federally\nmandated protocols rather than just winging it on their own devices.” The 2019\nransomware attack against the city government of Baltimore represents one of the\nworst municipal cybersecurity disasters on record, paralyzing city services for\nmonths and costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. Now the Department of\nJustice has unexpectedly revealed that it arrested one of the hackers behind\nthat attack, 37-year-old Sina Gholinejad, in North Carolina last January, and\nthat he has pleaded guilty in court. Gholinejad has admitted to being involved\nin the larger Robbinhood ransomware campaign that hit other targets, including\nthe cities of Greenville, North Carolina, and Yonkers, New York. It’s still far\nfrom clear how Gholinejad was identified or why he traveled from Iran to the US,\ngiven that most ransomware criminals are careful to remain in countries that\ndon’t have extradition agreements with the US government and are thus beyond US\nlaw enforcement’s reach. Indeed, the indictment against him names several\nunnamed co-conspirators who may be still at large in Iran. More than 2 million\ndocuments left exposed in a public database have revealed Russia’s nuclear\nweapons facilities in unprecedented levels of detail, according to reporting\nthis week by Danish media outletDanwatch and Germany’s Der Spiegel. Reporters\nexamined the huge trove of documents relating to Russian military procurement—as\nRussian authorities slowly restricted access—and found blueprints for nuclear\nfacilities across the country. Experts called the leak an unparalleled breach of\nRussia’s nuclear security, with the data potentially being incredibly useful for\nforeign governments and intelligence services. The documents show how Russia’s\nnuclear facilities have been rebuilt in recent years, where new facilities have\nbeen created, detailed site plans including the locations of barracks and\nwatchtowers, and the locations of underground tunnels connecting buildings.\nThere are descriptions of IT systems and security systems, including information\non surveillance cameras, electric fences being used, and the alarm systems in\nplace. “It’s written explicitly where the control rooms are located, and which\nbuildings are connected to each other via underground tunnels,” Danwatchreports.\nLicense-plate-recognition cameras are creatinghuge databases of people’s\nmovements across America—capturing where and when cars are traveling. For years\nthere have been concerns that the cameras could be weaponized by law enforcement\nofficials or private investigators and turned against thoseseeking abortions or\nproviding abortion-related care. Officials from Johnson County Sheriff’s Office\nin Texas—where nearly all abortions areillegal—searched 83,000 Flock license-\nplate reader cameras at the start of this month while looking for a woman they\nclaim had a self-administered abortion,404 Media reported this week. Sheriff\nAdam King said that the officials weren’t trying to “block her from leaving the\nstate” and were searching for the woman as her family was concerned about her\nsafety. However, experts say that conducting a search across the entire United\nStates shows the sprawling dragnet of license-plate-reader cameras and\nhighlights how those seeking abortions can be tracked. “The idea that the police\nare actively tracking the location of women they believe have had self-\nadministered abortions under the guise of ‘safety’ does not make me feel any\nbetter about this kind of surveillance,” Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity\nat the Electronic Frontier Foundation told404 Media. Philippines-based company\nFunnull Technology and its boss, Liu Lizhi,have been sanctionedby the US\nTreasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control for their links to investment and\nromance scams, which are often referred to as “pig-butchering” scams. “Funnull\nhas directly facilitated several of these schemes, resulting in over $200\nmillion in US victim-reported losses,” OFAC said in astatementannouncing the\nsanctions. The company purchases IP addresses from major cloud service providers\nand then sells them to cybercriminals who could use them to host scam\nwebsites—OFAC says Funnull is “linked to the majority” of investment scam\nwebsites reported to the FBI. In January independent cybersecurity\njournalistBrian Krebs detailed how Funnullwas abusing Amazon’s and Microsoft’s\ncloud services.

Google One isthe company's subscription cloud\nstorage service, with several tiers offered at monthly fees, and higher tiers\nthat include the latest Google Gemini artificial intelligence features. Every\nGoogle account comes with 15 gigabytes of free cloud storage shared across\nGoogle Drive, Google Photos, and Gmail. But with videos of your kids, hi-res\nphotos of your pets, and work files, that space doesn’t stretch far today.\nGoogle One storage can be shared with your family, but it’s just the start—there\nare other benefits to subscribing. If Google’s not for you, there areother cloud\nstorage options. If you want tochange your data-hoarding habits, we also have\nadvice onhow to stay under your 15 GB allowance. All in on Apple? Read our guide\ntoApple One. Updated May 2025: We've added Google’s new AI Ultra and AI Pro\n(formerly Premium) plans, removed discontinued benefits such as VPN service, and\nupdated the benefits of each tier. Google One hasfive main tiers: In the\nunlikely event that 2 terabytes is not enough, you can increase your storage.\nThe option to upgrade to an even larger plan is available only for current\nsubscribers and in select countries. The main benefit of a Google One plan is\nthe extra cloud storage you can share with up to five family members. While\nfamilies can share the same space, personal photos and files are accessible only\nto each owner unless you specifically choose to share them. Everyone in the\nfamily can also share the additional benefits (provided you all live in the same\ncountry). Let’s take a closer look at those benefits: Magic Editor enables you\nto delete unwanted people or objects from the background of your photos, tweak\nthe look of the sky, change the position of people and objects, and more with\nthe help of generative AI. All features work with eligible shots in your Google\nPhotos app. Without a subscription, you are limited to 10 saves per month. These\nfeatures are available onGoogle Pixel phones, even if you don't subscribe to\nGoogle One. The 2-TB plan nets you 10 percent back in Google Store credit for\nany purchases. This could prove useful if you're thinking about buying multiple\nGoogle devices. The credit can take up to one month to get after your purchase,\nand it will have an expiry date attached. The Premium plan includes Google\nWorkspace Premium, which gives you enhanced features in Google Meet and Google\nCalendar. For example, you can have longer meetings with background noise\ncancellation or create a professional booking page to enable other people to\nmake appointments with you.

         "Analysts Say Trump Trade Wars Would Harm the Entire US Energy Sector, From Oil to Solar",
         "This story originallyappeared onInside Climate Newsand is part of theClimate\nDeskcollaboration. The Trump administration’s ever-changing policies on tariffs\nand trade have injected chaos into the global energy economy. On Wednesday,a\nfederal court blockedPresident Donald Trump from being able to adopt tariffs\nunder an emergency-powers law. The administration is appealing the ruling. This\nsets up additional legal wrangling in addition to the conflicts over trade that\nwere already happening. Analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie gave\nthemselves the task of predicting where US tariff policy may be heading. The\nresult isa reportissued this week, “Trading Cases: Tariff Scenarios for Taxing\nTimes,” that shows the huge gap in outcomes between a trade war and a trade\ntruce. My main takeaway from it is that everyone loses in a prolonged conflict.\nEven the oil and gas industry, which has close ties to the Trump administration,\nwould face falling prices for its products at the same time that the costs of\nmuch of its equipment are rising because of tariffs. The US renewable energy and\nbattery industries stand out for the potential severity of their downturns\nbecause development here relies heavily on components made in other countries.\nThe Biden administration sought to encourage manufacturers to build in the\nUnited States, but those efforts are still in their early stages, and many of\nthe government incentives arenow on the chopping block. Under a “trade truce”\nscenario, in which tariffs return to 2024 levels, the global economy would grow\nby an average of 2.7 percent between now and 2030, the report says. The “trade\ntensions” scenario would mean that tariff barriers increase compared to last\nyear, but the economy would still grow, albeit at a lower rate. The most\ndamaging is the “trade war” scenario, with the United States maintaining an\neffective tariff rate of 30 percent or more, leading to a global recession. The\nreport says the middle forecast, “trade tensions,” is the most likely to occur.\nWhy is this conflict happening? The short version is that Trump and his advisers\nbelieve that tariffs will help the US economy by encouraging construction of\nfactories here, reducing trade deficits and punishing barriers to entry of US\nproducts in other countries. “We will supercharge our domestic industrial base,”\nTrump said in an April 2 speech announcing tariffs on nearly every US trading\npartner. “We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers\nand ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower\nprices for consumers.” A tariff is a tax charged by a government on imports. As\nthe US government has increased its tariffs, other countries have retaliated\nwith their own increases. Adding to the chaos is that the policies frequently\nchange, with the president often announcing shifts on social media, as happened\nin recent days ontariffs on the European Union. I spoke with Chris Seiple, Wood\nMackenzie’s vice chairman for power and renewables, to drill down on the parts\nof the report that deal with renewables. Here is that conversation, edited for\nlength and clarity: Dan Gearino: For renewable energy industries, is the big\nproblem that tariffs make everything more expensive, or is there more to it than\nthat? Chris Seiple:Sure, things getting more expensive is a big part of it. I\nthink the second challenge, and this is kind of unique to the power business, is\nthat there’s a heavy hand of regulation. And so there’s a lot of US utilities\nthat have to go through pretty extensive regulatory processes to get approval\nfor what they want to build. Being in a world where there’s so much tariff\nuncertainty, they don’t know what it’s going to cost to build what they want to\nbuild. It’s particularly challenging for this industry to be able to navigate\nthat, and it impacts renewables more than it impacts, say, other sectors like\ngas or coal, because we rely upon imports of equipment to such a bigger degree,\nespecially for battery storage, where we’re essentially entirely dependent at\nthis point on imports from China. With battery storage, there has been an\nattempt to increase manufacturing capacity in the US. How would you characterize\nwhere that stands? Very early days. A lot of battery manufacturing that’s going\non within the US is meant to supply batteries to EV vehicles, not stationary\nutility-scale storage projects. And so the amount of manufacturing capacity in\ncomparison to what the demand is for that equipment results in us importing well\nmore than 90 percent of what we need. Chris Seiple is Wood Mackenzie’s vice\nchairman for power and renewables. I also think the tariff on it is just as\nimportant as the uncertainty about not knowing where the end game is and what\nthe tariffs are going to be. So, if you’re on the manufacturing side of the\nrenewables business, you’re making investment decisions that have very long\nlives when you’re building a manufacturing facility. Having that uncertainty\naround the investment climate and what the level of tariffs is going to be over\nthe long-term just makes it more challenging to make all of those decisions.\nDuring the early part of this year, as this tariff war was starting, I had,\nlike, biweekly calls from this manufacturer in Korea, just exasperated, saying,\n“Doesn’t the US government know that we’re making long lead time decisions, and\nwe need to have some sort of clarity around what the policy environment is going\nto be, not just for the next four years, but for the next 10 years?” The US is\nmaking it very challenging right now to make these types of investment\ndecisions. Is there any US energy industry that benefits from trade tensions? I\ndon’t think anybody benefits, per se, from the trade tensions. Everybody, no\nmatter what part of the energy sector you’re in, is having to navigate the\nuncertainty around what the tariff levels are going to be. That said, the\noverall policy environment has changed to one that is more favorable for natural\ngas. The fact that we are an exporter of natural gas and have all of the\ndomestic resources that we need makes it less impacted by tariffs than what\nother sectors are, like renewables. But even for E&P [exploration and production\nof oil and gas], they utilize steel in that process. There are tariffs on steel.\nSteel prices have gone up. It has a negative impact on all energy sectors. One\npart of this report that jumped out to me is you said that the US may be stuck\nwith older technologies, especially when it comes to solar, while the rest of\nthe world advances at a quicker pace. What’s the long-term effect of that?\nBefore I answer that question directly, let me just give you some context. We\nestimate that the cost of building a utility-scale solar project is about $1.15\na watt in the US. The comparable number in China is about 42 cents a watt. It’s\nnot surprising that the cost of building a solar facility in China is a lot less\nthan the cost of building a solar facility in the US. What is very surprising\nwhen we put this data together is how much less expensive it is to build a solar\nproject in Europe than it is in the US. It’s about 70 cents a watt to build a\nsolar facility in Europe compared to the US. So the US is almost 50 percent more\nexpensive to build a solar facility than the cost of building it in Europe. And\nthe biggest reason that it’s more expensive here is because of all the tariffs\nthat we have on solar. It’s not the only reason, but it’s the biggest reason. So\nwe’ve already kind of penalized solar with the tariffs that we have in place.\nAnd then, on the technology evolution issue, it’s the Chinese manufacturers that\nhave the most sophisticated capability in solar manufacturing, and who are\nputting a lot more R&D into it than any US company is doing. And so, we\nessentially have policies in place that prohibit and make it uneconomic for US\ncompanies to be able to purchase Chinese technology, then that is what leaves us\nin a position where we’re not using the most advanced technology that’s\navailable to the rest of the world. The long-term implication of that is it\ndeprives the US of a low-cost source of energy that’s available everywhere else,\nand creates kind of an unlevel playing field in our efforts to have to power our\nindustries with the lowest-cost energy solutions that are available. These\ntariff policies seem to change almost daily. Is there an expectation that\neventually things will settle down? I think that’s the central challenge for the\nindustry, that they don’t know where the ultimate outcome is going to fall.\nNobody can really fully answer that question, and what makes it particularly\nchallenging is that there’ve been so many different rationales given as to why\nwe’re pursuing one tariff or another that it makes it hard to divine what the\nultimate endgame is going to be. Is it about reducing a trade balance? Is it\nabout supporting domestic manufacturing? Are there other policy goals that are\ntrying to be achieved as a result of the tariffs? Not knowing that is what makes\nit very difficult for people to operate day to day.

         "DOGE Is Busier Than Ever—and Trump Says Elon Musk Is 'Really Not Leaving'",
         "Elon Musk will not be fully exiting the so-calledDepartment of Government\nEfficiency(DOGE)—and its activities are only intensifying. On Friday,President\nDonald Trumpthrew cold water on the idea that Musk would fully disappear from\nDOGE andthe White Houseforever. \"Elon's really not leaving,” Trump said in a\njoint press conference with Musk in the Oval Office. “He's gonna be back and\nforth. It's his baby, he's going to be doing a lot of things.\" “I expect to\ncontinue to provide advice,\" Musk, wearing a black hat with DOGE written on it\nand a black shirt reading “DOGEFATHER,” said during Friday's press conference,\nwhile noting that his legal limit for service as a special government employee\nwas coming to an end. \"I expect to remain a friend and an advisor.” Federal\nworkers from at least six agencies tell WIRED thatDOGE-style workis escalating\nin their departments. Both new and familiar DOGE faces have also been recently\ndetailed to new agencies, according to sources. Members of Musk’s early DOGE\nteam, including Luke Farritor, Gavin Kliger, Edward Coristine, and Sam Corcos,\nhave met with a number of departments and agencies—including the Treasury, the\nOffice of Management and Budget, and the FBI—in recent days, seemingly\ncontinuing business as usual, WIRED has learned. The team also appears to be\nactively recruiting, according to documents viewed by WIRED. Over the last week,\nfederal workers have also been asked to urgently review and potentially cancel\ncontracts across the government. Trump appeared to confirm that contracts were\nunder review at Friday’s press conference: \"Many contracts, Elon, right now are\nbeing looked at,” he said. Some agencies have also received visits from DOGE at\ntheir headquarters, WIRED has learned. “This doesn’t sound like a group that is\ngoing away, it sounds like one that’s digging in like a parasite,” an IT\nspecialist at the Department of Agriculture (USDA) tells WIRED. Since DOGE first\nbegan its work in Washington in late January, its representatives have been\neager to cut what they see as superfluous spending in government. In recent\nweeks, the pressure to slash and cancel contracts, specifically focused on\nworkforce management and IT, has drastically increased, multiple sources at a\nvariety of agencies tell WIRED. “Biggest thing is we are being asked to cut as\nmany contracts for software and labor as possible,” one tech worker at the\nDepartment of the Interior (DOI) tells WIRED, saying that the stated goal, as\nthey understand it, has been “to save money and efficiency in consolidated IT.”\n“We are cutting developers, telecom, server admins, call center staff etc.,” the\nDOI source says. “Some things were bloated and could use the cut. Others are\ngoing to suffer, and our service to the public is going to be degraded.”\nEmployees at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and all the\nagencies under its umbrella, were told that contracts would have to go through a\nnew approval process called the Departmental Efficiency Review (DER). Any\nrequisitioning or contract approval is paused until after workers submit a form\nto start the DER and the deputy secretary’s office reviews the funding,\naccording to an email about the process obtained by WIRED. The email also states\nthat the review will flag any contracts that appear to be expensive and\nexcessive. Urgent contract oversight is also occurring at the Department of\nLabor (DOL). “There is a LOT of pressure to end these contracts as soon as\npossible, within the next few days,” a source at the DOL told WIRED on Thursday.\nAt other agencies, like the USDA and the Treasury, some tech workers were\nrecently notified that they may be asked to interview with someone at DOGE for\nan unspecified reason. “Just last week we were warned of possible contact from\nDOGE for interviews,” the USDA IT source says, adding that no one told workers\nwhat the interviews would be about. At Treasury, employees were told those who\nperform “some of the more technical functions” would be pulled into these\ninterviews. Tech contractors at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), one of\nthe first agencies DOGE burrowed into, were suddenly let go after returning from\nthe long Memorial Day weekend. Their termination letters credited DOGE with\ntheir dismissal. “The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM), under\nthe direction of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has modified\nthe IT services contract with RMCI [an IT contractor] that you support,” the\ntermination letters say. “As a result, it is with regret that your work on the\nOPM contract will end.” During Friday’s press conference, Trump gifted Musk what\nappeared to be a golden key in a box that had a picture of the White House,\nthanking him for his last few months of government work. “DOGE is integral to\nthe federal government’s operations, and its mission, as established by the\nPresident’s executive order, will continue under the direction of agency and\ndepartment heads in the Trump administration,” White House spokesperson Harrison\nFields tells WIRED. “DOGE has delivered remarkable results at an unprecedented\npace, and its work is far from complete.” United States DOGE Service\nadministrator Amy Gleason did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n“Elon may be stepping away, but DOGE’s mission remains stronger than ever.\nExposing reckless, wasteful government spending isn’t about one individual—it’s\nabout a lasting overhaul of Crazy Town,” congressman Aaron Bean, chair of the\nHouse DOGE caucus, tells WIRED about the group’s continued work. “From reducing\nfraudulent payments by reforming the Treasury payment system to modernizing\nfederal processes, like the OPM retirement system, the House DOGE Caucus is\nworking to codify targeted spending cuts to rein in government overreach and\ndeliver real accountability to the American people. We are also working closely\nwith the White House to ensure recession packages reflect DOGE’s critical\nfindings—turning transparency into action. Rest assured, the House DOGE Caucus\nis here for the long haul, and our work is just getting started.” Matt Giles and\nVittoria Elliott contributed reporting.

         "L'article aborde la situation actuelle autour du département de l'efficacité gouvernementale (DOGE), dirigé par Elon Musk, qui malgré l'approche de la fin de son mandat en tant qu'employé gouvernemental spécial, continue d'exercer une influence notable. Lors d'une conférence de presse à la Maison Blanche, le président Donald Trump et Elon Musk ont clarifié que Musk continuerait à conseiller et à influencer le département, bien qu'il ne soit plus officiellement en charge. \n\nLes activités de DOGE sont en augmentation, comme l'ont indiqué des employés fédéraux de diverses agences. L'équipe de Musk chez DOGE semble être active dans l'examen et la révision des contrats gouvernementaux, en particulier ceux liés à la gestion du personnel et aux technologies de l'information, avec pour objectif déclaré de réduire les dépenses jugées superflues.

La pression pour réduire les coûts est forte et les agences doivent se soumettre à un nouveau processus d'approbation des contrats appelé Departmental Efficiency Review (DER). \n\nEn conclusion, même si Elon Musk se retire progressivement de son rôle opérationnel au sein de DOGE, son influence et la mission du département persistent.

         "Never Drink Alone: A Guide to Turkish Coffee",
         "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.\nHowever, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of\nproducts through these links. Out of allcaffeinated rituals, Turkish coffee\ntakes the (coffee) cake. That’s because, according to some experts, Turkish\ncoffee isn't a type of coffee—it’s a cooking method. Commonly seen across Middle\nEastern cultures, the beverage looks and acts similar to espresso, served in a\nsmall cup and tasting very rich yet very different. Turkish coffee is made with\ncoffeeground finerthan espresso (the ideal Turkish coffee grind has a flourlike\nconsistency) and a brewing process that involves boiling three times. It's an\nunfiltered drink, so the coffee grounds eventually settle to the bottom of the\ncup. The grounds make for a thick drink, but they also play an important role in\nthe auspicious ritual of fortune telling, a practice that ultimately inspired my\nlove for the brew. My introduction to Turkish coffee was with my sister’s\nIranian family (we have different fathers. Her father, Ali, is from Iran). Upon\nvisiting them to celebrate the Persian New Year, my sister’s aunt made Turkish\ncoffee after dinner one evening and a family friend proceeded to “read” the\ncoffee grounds and tell us our fortunes (I dive into the specifics of this\nprocess more below). While I cannot adhere to the validity of fortune telling, I\nwill say that the family friend predicted I’d have a son. That was over 10 years\nago. At the end of 2024, I gave birth to my first child, a healthy baby boy. But\nyou don’t have to get your fortune told to enjoy Turkish coffee. You also don’t\nhave to search too far and wide across the coffee forums to find strong opinions\nabout the strong coffee and how it should be made. This was possibly my biggest\nsetback in research, as there are those who suggest beginning the brew with hot\nwater, while others suggest cold water. Some suggest sugar, others without. Some\nsuggest high heat, others low. You might have even seen Turkish coffeebeing\nprepared in sand. (The owner at my local Palestinian deli tells me that this is\nmostly a tourist gimmick.) So, to the coffee nerds, the anal and the meticulous,\nif you’re hoping for a “right” way to make Turkish coffee, I hate to disappoint\nyou. Those who make Turkish coffee in their home regularly measure and brew with\ntheir heart, and each household has a similar but almost always slightly\ndifferent method. It’s your preferences that will ultimately guide the ins and\nouts of your brewing. Turkish coffee is often served in a cup that's usually no\nmore than 2 ounces. It might look similar to espresso, but while espresso is\nbrewed under high pressure, Turkish coffee is brewed by boiling finely ground\n(even more fine of a grind than espresso) coffee in acezve. A cezve (referred to\nas anibrikin other countries like Palestine) is a small pot with a long handle,\nusually holding around 10 to 15 ounces and made out of copper. Demmex Amazon\nGenerally, Turkish coffee is boiled in the cezve in three parts. After each\nboil, a small amount is poured into the coffee cup. The cezve is returned to the\nstove after each pour until you’ve filled your cups. The process of boiling the\ncoffee multiple creates a thick and frothy coffee that is very strong and very\naromatic. Ideally, Turkish coffee is ground with a traditional Turkish coffee\ngrinderlike this. Because Turkish coffee is ground to a fineness that most\ncommercialcoffee grinderscannot achieve, your best bet is to buy it pre-ground\n(I’ve suggested a few brands below). I almost considered using mySana Grain\nMill(8/10, WIRED Recommends) to see if I could achieve the grind, but didn’t\nwant to risk the coffee flavor in my homemade flour. Elite Amazon Traditionally,\nfinely ground Turkish coffee is mixed with water in a cezve, along with some\nsugar, depending on your preferences. You’ll bring the coffee to a boil on\nlow/medium heat over an open flame, usually in three parts. The first boil will\ndevelop a foam (think crema, as seen in other coffee drinks). This foam is\nessential to Turkish coffee, as the drink’s frothy thickness makes it stand out\nfrom others. Some recipes suggest using a spoon to scoop the initial foam into\nyour prepared cups. Otherwise, you’ll use the cezve to pour it into your\nprepared coffee cups a little at a time. Put the cezve back on the stove to boil\nand repeat this process twice more until you’ve filled your coffee cups to the\nrim. Caizen Amazon As I mentioned earlier, it’s important to note that, unlike\nother coffee styles in which technicality is prioritized with scales and\nthermometers, you’ll see neither of these aspects come into play when making\nTurkish coffee. With roots that date back to the 16th century in the Ottoman\nEmpire, Turkish coffee is a drink integrated into and born of a culture. So,\nthink of Turkish coffee like your grandma’s cooking—a recipe acts as a guide,\nbut it is ultimately a process that is led with the heart. You may not place\nmuch stock in auspicious practices, and I don’t blame you. But in case you’re\ncurious, there are traditions to be respected. The fortune-telling process\nbegins once you’ve finished your drink. You’ll place your coffee cup upside down\non its saucer. The grounds will drip and scatter, and this is what the fortune\nteller will analyze to determine your fortune. Kurukahveci Mehmet Efendi Amazon\nJust as my family friend read my coffee grounds on that fateful day 10 years\nago, the practice of fortune telling through Turkish coffee should be done\nbysomeone who is experienced in the craft. It is strongly suggested that you do\nnot try to read your own fortune. This act of fortune telling also establishes\nsomething important when it comes to Turkish coffee: It's a social\nactivity—something meant to be enjoyed with company. It’s not a science. A great\nexample of this is my local Palestinian deli using hot water to make its Turkish\ncoffee. Beginning with hot water may go against what some coffee aficionados\nrecommend (beginning with cold water is usually ideal for any brewing process to\nachieve optimal flavor and extraction), but many places selling Turkish coffee\ndo this to speed up the process and serve their customers more quickly. When\nmaking the recipe below, don’t focus on being too technical. Demmex Amazon\nYields 2 2-ounce cups of Turkish coffee Combine Turkish coffee, sugar, and water\nin your cezve. Stir until combined. Put cezve over a low/medium gas stove flame\nand slowly bring to a boil over a couple of minutes (if it boils too fast, it’s\nharder to develop the initial foam). Once boiling to the top, quickly take the\ncezve off the stove and pour a small amount into your prepared cups (about half\nan ounce). Return the cezve to the open flame and bring to a boil. Repeat steps\n3 to 4 twice more until you’ve filled your cups to the brim.

         "L'article explore en profondeur la culture et la méthode de préparation du café turc, un rituel de caféine distinctif et riche en tradition. Contrairement à d'autres types de café, le café turc est reconnu non seulement pour son goût intense mais également comme une méthode de cuisson unique. Le café est moulu très finement, presque comme de la farine, et est cuit par ébullition en trois étapes dans un cezve, une petite casserole en cuivre avec un long manche. Cette méthode produit un café épais et mousseux.\n\nLe café turc est souvent associé à la pratique de la divination par la lecture des marcs de café, un aspect culturel qui renforce son rôle dans les interactions sociales plutôt que comme simple boisson. Selon les traditions, après avoir bu le café, la tasse est retournée pour que les marcs de café puissent être interprétés par un diseur de bonne aventure expérimenté.\n\nL'article souligne également les diverses opinions sur la préparation du café turc, y compris les débats sur l'utilisation de l'eau chaude ou froide, et avec ou sans sucre. Ces variations montrent que, comme dans la cuisine de grand-mère, la préparation du café turc est guidée par le cœur et les préférences personnelles plutôt que par des mesures strictes.\n\nEn conclusion, le café turc est plus qu'une boisson; c'est une expérience culturelle et sociale qui se transmet de génération en génération. Cette tradition offre une fenêtre sur l'importance des rituels culinaires dans le renforcement des liens communautaires et familiaux, invitant à une réflexion sur comment d'autres cultures intègrent des pratiques similaires dans leur quotidien.",

         "We Bought a ‘Peeing’ Robot Attack Dog From Temu. It Was Even Weirder Than Expected",
         "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.\nHowever, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of\nproducts through these links. In my 15years of reviewing tech, this pellet-\nfiring, story-telling, pretend-urinating robot attack dog is easily the\nstrangest thing I’ve ever tested. Arriving in a slightly battered box following\na series of questionable decisions onTemu, I’m immediately drawn to the words\n“FIRE BULLETS PET” emblazoned on the box. And there, resting behind the\nprotective plastic window with all the innocence of a newborn lamb, lies the\nplastic destroyer of worlds that my four-and-a-half-year-old immediately (and\ninexplicably), names Clippy. Clippy is a robot dog. Of sorts. And he (my son\nassures me that it’s a he), is clearly influenced by the remarkable, and\nsomewhat terrifying, robotic canine creations ofBoston Dynamics—a renowned\ncompany that’sleading the robot revolution. Naturally, given the $50 price tag\n(a little less if you don't want the—ahem—spinal-mounted pellet gun), I’m not\nexpecting Clippy to perform miracles. But, given mytrack record, being served an\nInstagram ad promising all manner of animatronic wizardry for less than the cost\nof a round of drinks in a London bar, the opportunity was too tempting to pass\nup. What happened, almost inevitably, was a lesson in not taking the social\nmedia ads you are served at face value. But, actually? It was also a lot of\nridiculous fun. After freeing Clippy from his box, I’m immediately met with some\nof the lightest, cheapest, glossiest plastic I’ve ever come across. I have\nnothing against plastic. Remember theNokia Lumia 920? Its polycarbonate body\nremains one of my favourite phone designs to this day. Sturdy, solid, and light,\nit was everything an object clad in plastic should be. Clippy and his\naccompanying remote, on the other hand, provide a somewhat Christmas cracker\ntoy-like level of confidence in their durability. Clippy’s main body, filled\nwith the bulk of the electronics, is weighty enough, but his four spindly legs\ndo not give the impression that they’re up to the task of supporting anything.\nExcept, of course, that I am in ownership of the turret-toting model, which\npromises to lay waste to enemies by bombarding them with water-absorbent pellets\n(more on that in a bit). Overall, the entire ensemble resembles an elongated\nCCTV camera on legs, with a turret resting on top—suitably menacing, and\ngenuinely not far off Boston Dynamic’s bona fide offering, in looks, at least.\nCourtesy of Esat Dedezade Elsewhere, I can only assume that the controller has\nbeen pumped full of helium, such is its hollow, airy lightness. Heavily inspired\nby the shape of an Xbox controller, I particularly love the fact that its bumper\nbuttons and triggers are simply formed from one immobile piece of moulded\nplastic. There’s something quite beautiful in their utter uselessness that I\nenjoy very much. As for the business end, it's an ADHD nightmare. Littered with\na chaotic array of buttons in seemingly no logical order, I give credit to the\ndesigners for creating a controller that laughs in the face of muscle memory.\nInitial attempts at turning Clippy on are unsuccessful. The on/off switch does\nnothing, and the charging light remains dead when the USB-C cable is plugged in.\nThere are no instructions. Opening the battery compartment reveals the\nculprit—the battery is disconnected. Was this to avoid it draining in transit,\nor to reduce the risk of spontaneous combustion? Either way, it’s plugged back\nin. Clippy lives. And wow, he’s loud. The built-in speakers are beyond shrill. I\ndesperately look through the carnage of controller buttons, hoping to find a\nvolume or mute option. There isn’t one. Naturally, I press “urinate” first.\nClippy’s hind leg raises. That, I expected. What I didn’t expect, was cheerful\nwhistling, and the sound of water tinkling into a toilet bowl. I look, and\nhappen upon the “handstand” button. This, I feel, will be an impressive test of\nhis dexterity. A handstand maneuver will surely call upon multiple gyroscopes\nand accelerometers, combining and crunching data from numerous sensors in real\ntime to ensure that Clippy’s body remains perfectly poised in balance. I press\nthe button, and Clippy immediately—and rather violently—faceplants. The force of\nthis manoeuvre takes me off guard, and the impact is loud. I am worried. A\nmoment passes, his rear legs rise, and they begin to twitch. I presume this\napparent seizure is meant to represent elegant scissor kicks. It’s reminiscent\nof how ants communicate with their antennae, a form of silent communication.\n“Don’t blame me bro, did you really expect anything else?” I can almost hear him\nplead. But, somehow, Clippy does return to his feet and appears unscathed, ready\nfor more. Me? I'm not so sure. As I mentioned, the controller has many, many\nbuttons—no less than 17 functions in fact—and I’m not going to bore you with\noverly gratuitous descriptions for each one. Instead, here’s a quick rundown of\nthe main buttons, to give you a general idea of some of Clippy's talents: Kung\nfu:Absolutely zero semblance of any martial art moves, or even a cheeky\nbackflip. Instead (and completely inexplicably), some form of poolside, Lost\nFrequencies-esque lounge music blasts out. Clippy “dances.” Swimming/Dance:I\nrecently saw Usher perform live. Both of these buttons involve vigorous floor-\nhumping that surpass even his most sexually charged efforts. A truly impressive\nfeat. Oh, and a side note for any optimists out there, Clippy is not waterproof.\nDo not, I repeat do not, introduce him to water. Push-up:Clippy blasts out push-\nups while playing the guitar riff from“Eye of the Tiger.” I have no further\nnotes. Story:Buckle up, pressing this button results in very loud, tinny\nclassical music blaring out over a spoken story. The narrator has an Eric\nCartman-like twang to their voice, and the speaker quality means I can barely\nmake out what’s being said. The only plot I manage to grasp is about an old\nwoman and an ageing cat. The woman scolds the cat for not being able to catch\nmice, as it has no teeth. The cat bestows a moral about respecting our elders\nfor the contributions they used to make in their youth. The next story, I think,\ninvolves a pigeon. It may be injured. Courtesy of Esat Dedezade Despite this\nclearly incredible skillset, it is interesting that Clippy's ability to be\ncontrolled or steered via the remote is … flawed. Going forward is generally\nfine, and there are left and right buttons which cause him to turn very slowly,\noften toppling over in the process. There is no reverse, so I constantly have to\npick him up before he collides with walls and furniture (no collision detection\ncameras appear to be present). He can, at least, shake hands (or \"hadn-shake\" on\nthe remote) like any well-trained pup. It would also be remiss not to mention\nthat there is an official app which lets you control your robot dog via\nBluetooth. Once you figure out how to change the language to English, it’s easy\nenough to navigate, and there are even some bonus features they couldn't squeeze\nonto the remote. For example, you can select different “foods” for him to eat,\nranging from a bone to “Nuclear Energy Source”—all of which result in various\nforms of eating animations. There’s also a voice command mode, which doesn’t\nseem to work. Despite offering all the permissions asked for (including, against\nmy better judgement, access to my phone and files), voice commands seem to fall\non deaf ears. There’s also a program mode which lets you set up custom actions,\nthough all my attempts seem to end up in more faceplants. According to the\nproduct page, Clippy’s back-mounted turret “can be loaded with water bombs to\nlaunch for fun.” The image accompanying this description is impressive. Two blue\nprojectiles appear to blast forth from the cannon. I immediately picture an\nautonomous robotic guard dog patrolling the house, scanning for threats, and\ndispensing justice as appropriate. The reality is a tiny packet of minuscule\nblue balls, about a millimetre in diameter. Once soaked in water for a few\nhours, they plump up, and you can load them into the turret, before firing away.\nThe test takes place in the makeshift bathtub firing range. I drop a few of the\nblue gel-like pellets into what is presumably the correct slot in the turret (I\nonce again remind you of the lack of any instructions), and tell my son to stand\nback, in case the velocity rebounds anything towards our eyes. I look down at\nthe controller, and finally press the “attack” button. Clippy walks forward a\nfew steps, crouches to steady his aim, and two pellets dribble out with all the\nurgency of a clogged ketchup bottle. This method is repeated about ten times,\nwith mixed results. At best, a pellet is fired relatively straight, but still\nnot without any meaningful force—certainly not enough to even penetrate a wet\nsquare of toilet paper. We tried. After the ammo is spent, we decide that it’s\ntime to watch him faceplant again. But should you buy this thing, as\n(relatively) cheap as it is? I think the answer is obvious. But while it’s all\ntoo easy to slate, playing around with Clippy has taken me back to my childhood,\nwhere toys like this were life. Clippy, as terrible as he is, has entertained my\nson daily, for the week that we've spent testing him. He brought him into our\nbedroom every morning, waking me up with a shrill, unintelligible story before\nblasting out a guitar riff with an enthusiasm that is already wearing thin. It\nwon’t be long, of course, before Clippy gathers dust in some corner, replaced by\nthe Next Thing. I imagine he’ll end up in a thrift store, awaiting a new family\nto dazzle and confuse in equal measure. I just hope, whoever they are, that they\nlike Survivor.

         "L'article examine une expérience personnelle avec un robot chien appelé Clippy, acheté après avoir été influencé par une publicité sur les réseaux sociaux. Clippy, qui est vendu pour environ 50 $, est décrit comme un robot qui tire des granulés, raconte des histoires et prétend uriner. Bien que le produit promette une gamme de capacités animatroniques à un prix abordable, l'auteur découvre rapidement que Clippy est principalement composé de plastique bon marché et possède des caractéristiques ludiques mais globalement inutiles. Les tentatives pour contrôler le robot via une télécommande ou une application sont entravées par des défauts de conception et une performance médiocre.\n\nMalgré ses nombreux défauts, Clippy procure un divertissement significatif, en particulier au fils de l'auteur, évoquant ainsi une nostalgie pour les jouets simples de l'enfance. L'article se termine sur une note réfléchissante, suggérant que, bien que Clippy ne soit pas un produit de haute technologie et puisse finalement être oublié, il offre un plaisir temporaire et rappelle l'importance des jouets dans le développement et l'amusement des enfants.\n\nCet article soulève des questions sur l'impact de la publicité sur les réseaux sociaux sur les comportements d'achat des consommateurs et l'importance de gérer les attentes face aux produits technologiques bon marché. Il ouvre également une réflexion sur la manière dont les technologies simples peuvent encore apporter de la joie et des souvenirs durables, malgré une ère dominée par des innovations technologiques de plus en plus avancées.",
